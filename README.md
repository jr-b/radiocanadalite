# Radio-Canada Lite

This is an attempt at making a French version of the CBC Lite website: cbc.ca/lite

Fetching data from the Radio-Canada API at build time, Eleventy creates pages for every news stories on the main Radio-Canada.ca sections.

## MVP Roadmap
1. Establish minimal list of lineups to fetch data from;
2. Hosted on Github, served by Netlify free tier;
3. Return 10 news stories from the main lineups;
4. Reuse the design from cbc.ca/lite

## To do
- [x] Page template - (https://www.11ty.dev/docs/pages-from-data/)[one page for each news story]
- [ ] Base template - from the one used on cbc.ca/lite
