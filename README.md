> ðŸš§ Work in progress ðŸš§

This is an attempt at making a French version of the CBC Lite website: [cbc.ca/lite](https://cbc.ca/lite)

Fetching data from the Radio-Canada API at build time, Eleventy creates pages for every news stories on the main [Radio-Canada.ca](https://ici.radio-canada.ca) sections.

## MVP Roadmap
1. Establish minimal list of lineups to fetch data from âœ…
2. Hosted on Github, served by Vercel âœ…
3. Return 10 news stories from the main lineups âœ…
4. Minimalist, unintrusive design âœ…
5. Trigger build with cron, calling the build hook from Vercel âœ…
