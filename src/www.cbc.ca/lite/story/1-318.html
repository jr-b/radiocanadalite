So that&#x27;s a concern.&quot;</p><p>Long said that even for people like Puro, who are vaccinated, homeless people face additional barriers if they want to access businesses that require photo ID and other documentation.</p><p>&quot;Not many of them have a mobile phone or a device to download the passport on,&quot; she said. &quot;Having a paper print out, again, there&#x27;s the potential to have it lost, to have it stolen. Your number one priority is not keeping this piece of paper safe.&quot;</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6086527">Memorial Park encampment forced to dismantle</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6135231">New grassroots group in Sudbury to provide transitional care for homeless, at-risk population</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6145333">Sudbury&#x27;s homeless can&#x27;t stay in Memorial Park, city says</a></li></ul></p><p>Long said she was relieved businesses like restaurants could still allow people inside without a vaccine passport if they were picking up takeout or delivery. </p><p>But she said that as the weather gets colder, a coffee shop can provide a homeless person temporary shelter from a northern Ontario winter.</p><p>&quot;A cup of coffee in a restaurant buys you an hour, maybe two hours of warming up in a coffee shop,&quot; Long said. &quot;To be able to go somewhere, access coffee and access warmth and a bathroom as well, it makes a big difference to get out of the cold.&quot;</p><blockquote class="pullquote">  &quot;I go out every morning and I make sure they get their coffee for the day anyway.&quot;  <cite class="pullquote-source">- Betty-Ann Serré, owner, Kuppajo Espresso Bar</cite> </blockquote><p>Betty-Ann Serré owns the Kuppajo Espresso Bar in downtown Sudbury and has made it a priority to serve vulnerable people.</p><p>Serré collects donations from her customers, and donates her own money, so she can give away coffee and muffins to people who are homeless.</p><p>Her coffee shop is located near Sudbury&#x27;s Memorial Park, where tent encampments were a common sight throughout the summer.</p><p>&quot;The sad thing about it is some of these kids are younger than my kids,&quot; Serré said. &quot;For me to go outside and sit with them, or when they used to come in and be able to sit down, to talk with them and just to hear them, it makes a difference.&quot;</p><p>Serré said she plans to continue to donate coffee and food to people who are homeless in Sudbury&#x27;s downtown area. She added the new vaccine certificate requirements don&#x27;t stop them from entering her shop to order a coffee to go.</p><p>But she echoed Long&#x27;s concern, that many of them either aren&#x27;t vaccinated, or don&#x27;t have access to a valid piece of photo ID, or their vaccine passport. </p><p>&quot;They lose things, stuff gets stolen from them so they can never provide me with that information,&quot; she said. &quot;I go out every morning and I make sure they get their coffee for the day, anyway.&quot;</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
