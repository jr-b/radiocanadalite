Houston said most citizens wouldn&#x27;t be able to go through a multi-year court process the way his party did to get the government to release information.</p><p>&quot;We happen to have the resources to do that because my chief of staff is also a lawyer. Most Nova Scotians can&#x27;t do that, so that&#x27;s unfair,&quot; he said.</p><p>Ralph has not talked yet with Houston, but welcomed the news and said she hopes to also be consulted during a review of the legislation, which hasn&#x27;t had a substantive update since 1993.</p><h2>Multi-year backlog</h2><p>She&#x27;s also feeling optimistic about what three new term positions her office is about to receive will do to help address an appeals backlog that has about 420 files.</p><p><a href="https://oipc.novascotia.ca/sites/default/files/reports/OIPC 2020-2021 Annual Report.pdf">Ralph&#x27;s office released its annual report on Tuesday,<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> drawing attention to the backlog, the ongoing increase in requests and the need for more resources and overhauling the act.</p><p>It can take upwards of four years for the office to get to a file and Ralph is hoping a near doubling of her investigations staff will help cut into that.</p><p>&quot;Once that&#x27;s in place, we should be able to really be reducing our backlog in a very significant way,&quot; said Ralph.</p><p><strong>MORE TOP STORIES</strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6151438">11 new COVID-19 cases in Nova Scotia on Tuesday</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6150908">N.S. cancer patient calls for third dose of COVID-19 vaccine for immunocompromised</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6151452">Nova Scotia man loses appeal in &#x27;Grabher&#x27; licence plate dispute</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6151195">Nova Scotians win big at Canadian paddling championships</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6150236">Advocates call for improvements to N.S. program that warns of dangerous drugs</a></li></ul></p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
