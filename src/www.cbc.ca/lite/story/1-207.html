(CBC /Radio-Canada)</p></div></div></div><div><p>New Brunswick reported 86 new cases of COVID-19 Monday, the highest one-day total since the pandemic began.</p><p>Forty-one people are now in hospital, up from 33 on Sunday, including 16 in intensive care. None of them are under the age of 19, Public Health said in a news release.</p><p>There are now 650 active cases of COVID across the province.</p><p>Premier Blaine Higgs says he expects similar numbers for about a week, but mused Monday about allowing some people who test positive to avoid self-isolation, if they&#x27;re fully vaccinated.</p><p>He also suggested the province may move toward more rapid testing in the weeks ahead.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6191201">Mandatory vaccinations for health workers may be coming, says premier</a></li></ul></p><p>&quot;There&#x27;s a way to manage this brand of COVID with vaccinations and testing that is different than before,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;So not everyone has to rush and isolate just because they test positive. And that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re working to get, and be able to provide clarity to that in the next day or two.&quot;</p><p>Higgs said the province has to find ways to live with COVID-19, knowing &quot;there&#x27;s a good 10 per cent&quot; of the population who won&#x27;t get vaccinated.</p><p>That includes finding ways to keep people at work, even if contact tracers determine they&#x27;ve been exposed to a positive case.</p><blockquote class="pullquote">  Even if you test positive, then you&#x27;re fully vaccinated, you&#x27;re not sick. So you may be able to keep working in certain conditions, but be protecting yourself and others in doing that.  <cite class="pullquote-source">- Blaine Higgs, premier</cite> </blockquote><p>He believes rapid testing can help.</p><p>&quot;If they&#x27;re fully vaccinated, that doesn&#x27;t mean they have to go home. You&#x27;d be able to test and then say, &#x27;OK, well, ...  I&#x27;m not testing positive, so I&#x27;m good, I keep working.&#x27;</p><p>&quot;But then even if you test positive, then you&#x27;re fully vaccinated, you&#x27;re not sick. So you may be able to keep working in certain conditions, but be protecting yourself and others in doing that.&quot;</p><p>Higgs said someone 19 or under could test positive without even realizing they have COVID. &quot;And it&#x27;s not a big issue other than, you know, you might transmit to someone else. But if that someone else is vaccinated, then that isn&#x27;t a problem either in, you know, 98 per cent of the cases.&quot;</p><p>The Department of Health did not respond to a request for comment.</p><h2>&#x27;Very dangerous policy&#x27;</h2><p>Rod Russell, a professor of immunology and infectious diseases with Memorial University in Newfoundland, contends it would be a &quot;very dangerous policy&quot; to tell people who test positive that they may not have to isolate.</p><p>A positive test is not a black and white binary issue, he said. Someone can test positive early and be about to become very symptomatic or test positive late and be almost recovered.</p><p>&quot;You may not be infectious at all to somebody who&#x27;s vaccinated, you may not be infectious at all to anybody if you have really, really have mild cases. But the point is, you don&#x27;t know.</p><p>&quot;So anybody who tests positive should always isolate, in my opinion. At least until you see, you know, if you&#x27;re going to have symptoms because we know that the more symptoms you have, the more chance you have of spreading the disease.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Rod Russell"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Rod Russell</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Rod Russell is a professor of immunology and infectious diseases at Memorial University.  (CBC)</p></div></div></p><p>Even then, no one knows whether they could spread the virus to somebody else, said Russell.</p><p>Everyone has a different level of susceptibility based on numerous factors, such as their age, vaccine status, and how long ago they got their vaccine.</p><p>&quot;A healthy looking 20-year-old could have a severe immunodeficiency and nobody would know that.&quot;</p><p>Russell says he can see partly why the premier might want to move in that direction due to the false positives sometimes associated with rapid tests and not wanting people to have to isolate for days until they can get a follow-up PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test to confirm.</p><p>&quot;But again, you&#x27;re not going to know you have a false positive. A positive has to be treated as a positive, and everybody has to do the same thing.&quot;</p><p>Russell believes the policy would lead to clusters and outbreaks and worst case, would bring the virus to more vulnerable groups who are at risk of dying.</p><p>He &quot;can&#x27;t imagine&quot; New Brunswick will come out with such a policy.</p><p>&quot;There has to be a line and positive test has to be that line,&quot; he said.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Antigen testing kits"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Antigen testing kits</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Jennifer Russell has previously said rapid COVID-19 tests are useful for screening, but they&#x27;re not diagnostic.

They say it could deter some people from getting tested and isolating while awaiting their results.</p><p>Higgs acknowledged the backlog is an issue. &quot;We have to be able to test quickly.&quot;</p><p>Rapid COVID-19 test results can take as little as 15 minutes, while PCR test results usually take at least  24 to 48 hours.</p><p>Free self-screening rapid test kits are currently available to small- and medium-size businesses and organizations <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6091681">through the chambers of commerce</a> as part of a national program.</p><p>The goal is to proactively identify asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic workers and help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in workplaces and communities.</p><p>Larger employers, with more than 300 employees, can apply for rapid test kits <a href="https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/corporate/promo/covid-19/about-covid-19/testing-tracing.html#7">on the province&#x27;s website<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a>.</p><p>Testing kits are also available to certain workplaces under the <a href="https://www2.gnb.ca/content/dam/gnb/Departments/eco-bce/Promo/covid-19/point-of-care-program.pdf">point of care testing program<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a>.</p><p>Higgs said the province has &quot;thousands&quot; of kits and suggested their use could become more widespread, in schools and other areas.</p><p>&quot;I think we can start to move in that direction<strong> </strong>so it gives people more flexibility to determine their health and not lose time.&quot;</p><p>The province will provide more details on its website about how the kits will be made available, he said.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6190279">Expert says warnings about N.B.&#x27;s COVID reopening plan were voiced, ignored</a></li></ul></p><p>On Friday, when asked whether the province will use rapid test kits for schools, daycares or nursing homes, Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Jennifer Russell said it was &quot;sticking with&quot; its roll out through the chambers of commerce.</p><p>&quot;Can we move to something different in the future? We can definitely have conversations about that. But right now we&#x27;re not using those rapid tests widely in all those different settings, just in that business settings right now.&quot;</p><p>The PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests administered by Public Health remain the &quot;primary mode&quot; of testing for many reasons, she said.</p><p>They are considered the gold standard in diagnostic testing because of their accuracy. </p><p>&quot;But certainly we can still continue to have discussions around a further evolution of our testing.&quot;</p><p>Nova Scotia is looking for volunteers to help assemble <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6190201">300,000 take-home </a><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6190201">rapid COVID-19 testing kits</a> over the coming weeks to deal with an expected increase in testing needs.</p><p>The province is expected to reach the final phase of its reopening plan on Oct. 4, when gathering limits and the requirement to wear masks and maintain physical distancing in indoor public spaces will be lifted.</p><h2><strong>Only symptomatic, contacts should seek tests</strong></h2><p>As the province struggles to deal with a backlog of COVID-19 tests, it&#x27;s requesting only people with symptoms or those identified as a contact of a case get tested, and advising those who need a test for travel-related reasons to use private service providers. </p><p>The recent surge in COVID-19 cases is causing delays at assessment centres across the province and leading to &quot;longer-than-anticipated&quot; wait times for appointments and test results, Public Health said in a news release Monday.</p><p>Testing is conducted on a priority basis, with those who have symptoms tested first, said Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health.</p><p>&quot;So if you do not have symptoms or are not identified as a contact of a case, please self-monitor and only request a test if you are symptomatic,&quot; she said in a statement.</p><p>Anyone requiring a test for travel-related purposes is encouraged to review the COVID-19 testing requirements in other jurisdictions and plan accordingly, &quot;which could include seeking testing through private service providers.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Due to the high volume of tests for health needs, we are not able to expedite travel-related tests in the current testing regime,&quot; Russell said.</p><h2><strong>Public Health staff being asked to falsify vaccination documentation</strong></h2><p>Public Health staff are being asked to falsify vaccination documentation, according to the Horizon Health Network.</p><p>&quot;It has come to our attention that Public Health staff are being approached by members of the public who are requesting they falsify their vaccination record,&quot; the regional health authority said in a news release Monday.</p><p>&quot;This is concerning and Public Health staff will not oblige, as this is a crime,&quot; it said.</p><p>Horizon asks the public not to contact its staff with a request to produce false medical records.</p><h2><strong>Outbreak at Moncton Hospital geriatric unit</strong></h2><p>There is a COVID-19 outbreak at the geriatric unit of the Moncton Hospital, Unit 5200, and all visits are suspended until further notice, the Horizon Health Network announced on Monday.</p><p>Public Health did not mention the outbreak in its news release Monday.</p><p>Hospital staff are following enhanced infection prevention guidelines and patients are restricted to their rooms, according to the Horizon release.</p><p>No patients will be admitted or transferred during this time, it said.</p><p>The designated support person program for the geriatric unit is also suspended.</p><p>&quot;These temporary measures are in place to ensure the health and safety of our patients and clients, staff, physicians, and communities,&quot; the release said.</p><h2><strong>Closure of labour and birth unit continues</strong></h2><p>The closure of the labour and birth unit at the Upper River Valley Hospital to make room for COVID-19 patients will continue until Oct. 4 at 7 a.m., the Horizon Health Network announced Monday.</p><p>All pregnant women who would normally deliver their babies at the Upper River Valley Hospital will have to travel to the Dr. Everett Chalmers Regional Hospital in Fredericton instead.</p><p>Expectant mothers who are 35 weeks pregnant or more have been contacted by nursing staff, according to a news release.</p><p>The temporary <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6187922">closure was announced Friday</a>.
