Five months earlier, they&#x27;d seen it coming and asked for the deposit at their wedding venue to be returned. They&#x27;ve been locked in a battle ever since.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s ridiculous,&quot; says Fung, who&#x27;s angry the venue owner is holding onto their money, insisting a large wedding can still happen. </p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s just been incredibly frustrating.&quot; </p><p>Countless complaints on social media and reports from various legal experts suggest they are just one of hundreds of couples across Canada struggling to negotiate refunds from vendors who refuse to pay up, citing their own dire finances because of COVID-19.</p><ul>   <li> <p><strong>Got a story?

(Evan Mitsui/CBC)</p></div></div></p><p>Her fiancé liked it too, and they put down deposits totalling $10,200, roughly half the cost of the anticipated celebration to be held on Saturday, July 18 last year — a primo summer date for a wedding.</p><p>&quot;It was exciting for us to be able to plan our future,&quot; said Chan. &quot;We put a lot of effort, attention, and work into planning our wedding around this date.&quot; </p><h2>$2,000 more, then $5,000</h2><p>But when the pandemic got in the way, they were told they&#x27;d have to pay another $2,000 to reschedule to a similar summer date a year later. Shortly after, as more couples scrambled to reschedule, that figure grew to $5,000.</p><p>&quot;It was tough,&quot; said Fung, who refused to pay more since, she says, they had already paid premium prices for their original wedding date. Consequently, she says, they were initially offered only poor alternatives — weekdays in the middle of winter. </p><p>When they suggested cancelling the wedding altogether, they say they were told they&#x27;d have to fork over another $10,000, on top of their deposit, to cover what they committed to spending in the contract. That would&#x27;ve meant paying $20,000 for a wedding that never happened.</p><p><em><strong>WATCH | Fung, Chan face &#x27;logistical nightmare&#x27;:</strong></em></p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Media Video | &#x27;A logistical nightmare&#x27;"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Media Video | &#x27;A logistical nightmare&#x27;</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Joyce Fung and Calvin Chan share their struggle juggling multiple vendors after their wedding was postponed. </p></div></div></p><p>Fung and Chan argue they&#x27;re entitled to a refund of their deposit, because the venue did not deliver what was promised — a wedding with 100 guests on the original date.</p><p>&quot;When it comes down to the bare bones, the contract wasn&#x27;t fulfilled,&quot; said Fung. &quot;We&#x27;re being taken advantage of.&quot;</p><p>But the venue owner, Ben Graci, argues he&#x27;s protected — in part — because the three-page contract clearly says deposits &quot;are not refundable.&quot;</p><p>Another section in the contract deals with unexpected events that could affect delivery of services, commonly referred to as a &quot;force majeure&quot; clause.</p><p>Graci argues its language about &quot;causes beyond its control&quot; — like a pandemic — protects him from having to return the deposit.
