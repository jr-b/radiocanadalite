His brother was able to pay the fines the following day and Robinson was expected to be released that evening.</p><p>In a statement, Edmonton police said &quot;a male detainee became involved in a confrontation with ERC staff&quot; on Aug. 24.</p><p>Alberta Health Services said paramedics were dispatched to the remand centre around 9:22 p.m. that evening, arriving at the facility within 10 minutes.</p><p>Robinson&#x27;s mother, Marilyn Hayward, who lives in Ontario, said she called the facility on Aug. 24 to ask about her son.</p><p>She said a remand centre employee told her that Robinson became confrontational after being asked to wear a mask upon release, something she thought was odd, because her son hadn&#x27;t had a problem with that before. </p><p>Hayward said she didn&#x27;t learn for many hours that her son was in hospital. An ambulance was dispatched roughly 12 hours before she was made aware of the situation, she said.</p><p>After six days in a coma, Robinson, a father of two, was dead. The only explanation the family has received was that his heart stopped and his brain had been deprived of oxygen.</p><p>&quot;That doesn&#x27;t explain all of the marks on his — his whole head was just beaten,&quot; Hayward said in an interview.

Hayward teared up as she tried to explain the difficulty of travelling back and forth. She said that in the meantime, she hopes the autopsy report will answer some questions. </p><p>&quot;In a nutshell,&quot; she said, &quot;no one has given us any answers or any news that would be worthwhile knowing.&quot;</p><p>Robinson&#x27;s mother remembers him as forgiving and helpful, with a brilliant smile. </p><p>&quot;All he ever wanted to do really was his best, and to make others happy.&quot;</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
