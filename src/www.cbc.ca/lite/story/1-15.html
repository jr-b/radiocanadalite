We stand ready to help wherever we are needed.&quot;</p><p>Hajdu <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6190334">told CBC News on Sunday</a> that Saskatchewan has not yet formally requested federal aid, but that &quot;we&#x27;ll be ready as soon as they trigger that request.&quot;</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6191110">STARS Air Ambulance adds third helicopter crew rotation in Sask. to deal with growing COVID-19 cases</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6190334">Ottawa ready to help Sask. battle COVID-19 surge, federal health minister says</a></li></ul></p><p>The federal government is assisting in Alberta after the province made a formal request. It will help with air-lifting patients, ICU-registered nurses and respiratory therapists.</p><p>On Sunday, Saskatchewan set a new record for active cases, new cases and hospitalizations. On Monday, the province reported 289 hospitalizations, another all-time high.</p><p>Saskatchewan reported 552 new cases on Sunday, while Ontario — with roughly 13.5 million more people — reported 653.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Embed  | Saskatchewan&#x27;s vaccination progress"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Embed  | Saskatchewan&#x27;s vaccination progress</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY"> </p></div></div></p><p>Saskatchewan and Alberta have been hit hardest by the fourth wave. The two provinces&#x27; death rates are approximately quadruple the rest of Canada.</p><h2>Rapid tests</h2><p>As for rapid tests, the federal government <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/testing-screening-contact-tracing/rapid-tests-employees/saskatchewan.html">already offers free rapid antigen tests<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> for small and medium-sized businesses in Saskatchewan.</p><p>Two weeks ago, Moe said the province had secured one million rapid antigen tests from the federal government.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms/testing/increased-supply.html#a3">federal government&#x27;s records<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a>, Saskatchewan has received 3,731,392 rapid antigen tests. It has sent 3,102,308 tests to their final point-of-care setting. Only 618,260 of the more than 3.7 million tests received (16.5 per cent) have been reported used to Health Canada.</p><p>But the letter from Merriman details a request to the federal government for &quot;expedited approval&quot; of &quot;off-label&quot; rapid tests. </p><p>Those off-label tests cannot currently be supplied by pharmacies to the general public. </p><p>That&#x27;s something Merriman says he hopes is resolved as the province to looks to ramp up provincial testing. </p><p>&quot;Health Canada approval on these options would help our efforts on ensuring tests are readily accessible to the general public,&quot; the health minister wrote. </p><h2>Boosting vaccinations</h2><p>Last week, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6187634">Moe criticized the federal government</a> for not doing more to get people on First Nations vaccinated.</p><p>&quot;Our far north and Indigenous communities are running at a vaccination rate of less than 50 per cent — an area of exclusive federal jurisdiction,&quot; Moe tweeted. &quot;I hope … [Trudeau] will work with Saskatchewan to increase the vaccination rate in these critical communities right away.&quot;</p><p>Federal Indigenous Affairs Minister Marc Miller called Moe&#x27;s comments &quot;alarming and unproductive.&quot; In an online reply, Miller said Moe has a &quot;misunderstanding of his own health-care system and the role it plays&quot; in northern Saskatchewan.</p><p>The province&#x27;s far north regions are below the rest of the province when it comes to the percentage of eligible people fully vaccinated.</p><p>The far north central has 44 per cent fully vaccinated, the far northwest is at 49 per cent and the far northeast is at 54 per cent. The provincial average is 72 per cent. </p><p><em><strong>WATCH | What&#x27;s happening in Saskatchewan and Alberta hospitals: </strong></em></p><p><div><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Media Video | What’s happening inside Alberta, Sask. hospitals"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Media Video | What’s happening inside Alberta, Sask. hospitals</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Two infectious disease doctors talk to Ian Hanomansing about the situation inside Alberta and Saskatchewan hospitals and what the provinces need to do to get their COVID-19 surges under control. </p></div></div></div>Merriman&#x27;s letter briefly mentions a suggestion from the federal government that could see the use of Canadian Rangers and Indigenous community members set up mobile clinics in remote communities.</p><p>Saskatchewan and Alberta have the lowest percentage of eligible people vaccinated in Canada.
