They did exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to do: When you make a mistake — you fix it,&quot; said Labos.</p><p>&quot;The real problem here is that I worry that people are going to keep using the wrong version of the study to advance their agenda.&quot; </p><h2>Cherry-picking &#x27;rotten&#x27; data</h2><p>Despite not getting any mainstream media coverage in Canada or anywhere else at the time it was published, the study quickly spread around the world on social media and anti-vaccination websites, where it was incorrectly claimed as evidence of the damage COVID-19 vaccines cause.</p><p>The preprint has been shared on Twitter more than 11,000 times in the week since it&#x27;s been published, according to <a href="https://medrxiv.altmetric.com/details/113566287"><u>Altmetric</u><img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a>, a company that tracks where published research is posted online.
