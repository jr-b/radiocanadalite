(Nick Hawkins and Tom Cheney/Atlantic Salmon Federation)</p></div></div></p><h2>Impacts on aquatic life</h2><p>Low water levels were a worry for anglers even prior to this year&#x27;s salmon fishing season. According to Department of Fisheries and Oceans data, salmon returns to the lower Terra Nova River are about half what they were the year prior: just shy of 2,300 fish by Sept. 12, compared to 4,774 by the same date in 2020.</p><p>A warm summer and little rain can have &quot;lots of potential implications&quot; on aquatic life, said Purchase.</p><p>&quot;We have reports across central Newfoundland of acute impacts on salmon. So literally, salmon dying in the river and floating downstream,&quot; he said.</p><p>Survivors are stressed, and juvenile fish become concentrated in deeper, cooler pools. &quot;This means it&#x27;s more easy picking for predators like otters and minks,&quot; Purchase said. </p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6039257">Low, warm waters a concern for anglers setting up for start of salmon season</a></li></ul></p><p>Their food sources are also stressed, as dry stream beds provide little habitat for aquatic insects. Some of those bugs have multi-year life cycles, Purchase said, meaning there could be scarce nutrition years down the line.</p><p>While river levels besides Terra Nova seem to be bouncing back a bit, &quot;there&#x27;s still time&quot; for spawning, he said — most salmon spawn starting in the end of October — but salmon may not be able to move as far as they would like in the watershed.</p><p>&quot;They might be more concentrated in where they&#x27;re spawning, and this isn&#x27;t good for them, the growth of the offspring in future years,&quot; Purchase said.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Capelin"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Capelin</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Craig Purchase, seen here with capelin, is a fish biologist at Memorial University who studies fish reproduction.  (Craig Purchase)</p></div></div></p><h2>Potential trends</h2><p>In the big picture, this summer &quot;is a concern,&quot; said Purchase, and it&#x27;s not limited to 2021. &quot;There&#x27;s somewhat of a trend,&quot; he said.</p><p>Baird&#x27;s data points that way too.</p><p>&quot;It seems to be a bit of a trend. Four of the last 10 years have been low water levels, but this year really takes the cake,&quot; Baird said.</p><p>Baird worries what role climate change may be playing in the watersheds — and wants to have more people involved in preparing for this to potentially become the norm.</p><p>&quot;We need to look at land use practices, forestry practices, areas that need to be protected, cold water pools and tributaries and streams that are important fish habitat, where fish take refuge,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;We need to make sure they&#x27;re as resilient as possible. So we need to really look at our rivers much more closely in terms of how to respond to climate change impacts.&quot;</p><p><em><strong><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador">Read more articles from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a></strong></em></p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
