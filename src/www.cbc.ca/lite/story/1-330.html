With proof of vaccination rules now in effect in Ontario, Smith decided to pause indoor dining, rather than enforce those rules — at least for now. </p><p>&quot;It was a difficult decision to make,&quot; said Smith, who added that the decision does not have to do with opposition to vaccine requirements, but simply staffing and logistical concerns. </p><p>&quot;After discussing it with my staff, I think we have to have someone that is present, like a host or hostess, to see if they&#x27;re sitting or taking to go, and then asking for proof and verification of their vaccines.
