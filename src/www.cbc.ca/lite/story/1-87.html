Vaccines are not available to children under 12.</p><p>&quot;[People] are being denied things like chemotherapy, elective surgery and could eventually run into a triage protocol where worse things happen because of how clogged up the system is,&quot; he said. </p><p>&quot;We still have tools available to stop the spread of the virus in the community, but the government is just choosing not to use them. They say they can&#x27;t. The truth is, they won&#x27;t.&quot;</p><p>In a statement to CBC News, Steve Buick, Copping&#x27;s press secretary, said the health minister has &quot;a clear mandate&quot; from the premier to increase health system capacity, to educate vaccine-hesitant Albertans and increase vaccine coverage.</p><p>&quot;We&#x27;re supporting [Alberta Health Services] in taking every possible step to continue to provide care to critically sick patients,&quot; Buick wrote in the statement Sunday. </p><p>&quot;We have reached out to other provinces and federal agencies as part of contingency planning. No patients have been transferred out of the province and no specific federal assistance has been requested. We&#x27;ll update Albertans if and as decisions are made on any requests.</p><p>&quot;We have put proven measures in place to work to bend the curve and protect the health system.
