That policy applies to all secure areas of courthouses used by judicial officers and staff. </p><p>And as of Oct. 8, a policy will come into effect which says counsel, service providers and visitors wishing to access the secure areas of Alberta courthouses to which public access is restricted will be questioned about their vaccination status. </p><p>The chief justice of Ontario Superior Court of Justice ordered that only fully vaccinated Ontarians will be able to serve as jurors for the time being.
