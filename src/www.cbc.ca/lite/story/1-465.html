However, we&#x27;re also starting to hear from moderate United Conservative MLAs who are complaining Kenney waited too long to introduce the restrictions he reluctantly announced Wednesday.</p><p>&quot;We clearly had 30 days notice that a crisis was looming and nothing was done,&quot; said Calgary-Fish Creek MLA Richard Gotfried in a Facebook post Thursday.</p><p>&quot;It will cost us lives and I am gutted by the lack of responsiveness to unequivocal advocacy and clear warning signals.&quot;</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6178529">Calgary UCP MLA says Alberta&#x27;s COVID-19 inaction will &#x27;cost us lives&#x27;</a></li></ul></p><p>Gotfried might just be trying to placate his urban constituents but it still takes courage in the UCP caucus to speak out against Kenney or his policies.</p><h2>Tip of the iceberg?</h2><p>This might be the tip of a rebellious caucus iceberg that has sunk conservative Alberta premiers in the past.</p><p>In 1992, Progressive Conservative Premier Don Getty, who was plagued by a recession and chronic unpopularity, was forced out by a relatively gentle coup of his caucus.</p><p>In 2011, PC Premier Ed Stelmach resigned after terrified caucus members watched their party losing ground to the burgeoning Wildrose Party.</p><p>In 2014, PC Premier Alison Redford abruptly resigned after her &quot;culture of entitlement&quot; leadership style alienated her caucus and the public.</p><p>It&#x27;s important to note a precursor to these party coups was a collapse in the party&#x27;s fundraising.</p><p>Troubling for Kenney is the news that the NDP is routinely raising more money than the United Conservative Party.</p><p>Another troubling fact for Kenney is that his mishandling of COVID&#x27;s fourth wave has created problems for his federal counterpart and ally, Erin O&#x27;Toole, as the national election campaign enters its final weekend.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6178020">What we know about Alberta&#x27;s new vaccine passport (that&#x27;s not being called a passport) so far</a></li></ul></p><p>After praising Kenney&#x27;s handling of the pandemic just days ago, O&#x27;Toole faced a grilling by journalists Thursday morning asking what he thinks of Kenney now.</p><p>O&#x27;Toole, who doesn&#x27;t want to criticize Kenney but dare not praise him, repeatedly ducked the question and focused on blaming Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau.</p><p>A campaigning Trudeau, in turn, happily used Kenney&#x27;s COVID-19 failure to slam O&#x27;Toole and then promise to send federal pandemic aid to beleaguered Alberta.</p><p>To say Kenney is in trouble is to say Niagara Falls drips water.</p><p>It&#x27;s self-made trouble where Kenney has managed single handedly to obliterate his image as a competent leader. Voters will put up with a lot from their government as long as their premier has at least a veneer of competence. Kenney has rubbed that facade raw.</p><p>But he&#x27;s not likely going anywhere.</p><p>Yes, his unfortunate predecessors resigned for much lesser sins than running the province over a pandemic cliff. But as Albertans saw from Kenney&#x27;s performance Wednesday, he remains unrepentant and combative. And unlike his Conservative predecessors, Kenney is leader of a political party he built himself. What is the UCP if not Kenney&#x27;s UCP?</p><p>One day we&#x27;ll find out.</p><p>But Kenney will do everything he can to make sure that day will not come soon.</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
