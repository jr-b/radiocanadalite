But what it <em>isn&#x27;t</em> known for is its sexual and gender diversity.</p><p>I am a trans man, which means I was assigned female at birth, though the arbitrary gender marker didn&#x27;t reflect my true gender. Ever since I was young — even as young as eight years old — I knew something was different<em> </em>about me.</p><p>All children love to play and make believe, imagining themselves in all sorts of different roles and situations. </p><p>But what I noticed, even that young, was that playing traditional &quot;female&quot; roles just didn&#x27;t cut it for me. No matter what, I played &quot;male&quot; roles and felt much more comfortable doing so.</p><p>As I began questioning exactly why this was while going through puberty, I was left with many more questions and no answers. This was in the 1990s when the internet was still in its early stages. It wasn&#x27;t as user friendly and didn&#x27;t have the seemingly limitless access to resources like it does today. No one really talked about 2SLGBTQIA+ issues — an acronym that includes people who are two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, intersex, asexual, and more — and it certainly wasn&#x27;t talked about in my schools in Happy Valley-Goose Bay. </p><p>I had no idea where to go to figure out what I was feeling. I didn&#x27;t even have the language<em> </em>to figure out where to start.</p><p>As the internet evolved in my early teens, I discovered forums, chat rooms and online video games. It was there, while reveling in complete anonymity, that I was able to finally start exploring my gender to try and make sense of the world and myself. </p><p>I was happily able to identify as male and have other people accept it without question. It felt so right. </p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Mason Woodward and Isaac Woodward"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Mason Woodward and Isaac Woodward</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Mason, pre-transition, and his younger brother Isaac Woodward.  (Submitted by Mason Woodward)</p></div></div></p><p>Of course, the fear of being &quot;outed&quot; always loomed over me, making it harder still to be my truest self.</p><p>When I was in my senior year of high school, all these feelings of confusion about my gender were too much, so I approached my mother.</p><p>&quot;Mom, I think I should&#x27;ve been born a boy,&quot; I told her that fateful day. She was confused but supportive, though neither of us had the language or knowledge to truly tackle what was going on: gender dysphoria. </p><p>The conversation eventually turned towards my sexuality, although gender and sexuality are two distinct things. With nothing really being resolved, I continued on quietly living my double life, eventually leaving Happy Valley-Goose Bay.</p><p>In my mid- to late-20s, I started to finally get the terminology for everything I was feeling. Before then, I barely even knew what &quot;trans&quot; or &quot;transgender&quot; actually meant. </p><p>It was then that things started to click. I was massively relieved to hear that there were other people out there like me, though the idea of actually transitioning still seemed out of reach … until I saw a friend of mine had started. </p><p>I realized <em>I</em> could transition as well; that I no longer had to hide myself behind a computer screen.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Mason Woodward and Isaac Woodward"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Mason Woodward and Isaac Woodward</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Mason came out to Isaac, close his brother&#x27;s wedding in 2017.   (Submitted by Mason Woodward)</p></div></div></p><p>By the time I started medically transitioning (starting with hormone replacement therapy), I was 30 and living in the U.K. It was thrilling yet terrifying, since I wasn&#x27;t out to my family back home. When I came back to Canada, landing in Montreal, I still didn&#x27;t know how I&#x27;d deal with it all. But the hormone replacement therapy was doing its job, and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to hide the physical changes forever.</p><p>At this point, in 2017, a series of family emergencies meant I had to be around my loved ones more. I finally came out to my brother close to his wedding — the same guy who never seemed to question why I only ever played as a guy when we were kids. </p><p>When I did, he wrapped me up in his arms for a big hug and lovingly said, &quot;I wish you had told me sooner, I would&#x27;ve gotten you a suit&quot; for the wedding. </p><p>I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you what an emotional impact that one moment had on me, and still has on me, to this day.</p><p>Months later, I finally came out to my parents. However, they needed more time to come to terms with the revelation and figure things out on their own. Now, they&#x27;re my strongest allies and my relationship with them is even stronger than ever.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Mason Woodward"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Mason Woodward</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Mason and his family took part in the Pride March in Happy Valley-Goose Bay in 2021.  (Submitted by Mason Woodward)</p></div></div></p><p>When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I was living in Montreal. I eventually started to look at returning to my hometown. But I was scared.</p><p>I had a wonderful physician in Montreal who specialized in trans health care, and things were going well with my transition. I also had a lot of 2SLGBTQIA+ friends and the community in Montreal was so vibrant. </p><p>Thinking about Happy Valley-Goose Bay, I had the sinking feeling that I&#x27;d somehow have to go back into the closet. I hadn&#x27;t heard good things about the health care when it came to being trans and the 2SLGBTQIA+ community was practically invisible to me. </p><p>But my loneliness from the pandemic and the realization that life is too short made me finally come home.</p><ul>   <li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/topic/Tag/Opinion from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador"><u><strong>Perspectives matter: Read more N.L. opinion columns from our contributors</strong></u><img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a></li>  </ul><p>The transition into Labrador from Quebec was — and still is — a bit bumpy, between managing my hormone replacement therapy and finding a local physician that can confidently handle my ongoing care. Although things are looking better than I initially feared, I am still losing sleep wondering if I can truly be taken care of here in Labrador.</p><p>On top of all that stress, I&#x27;m slowly still trying to figure out where I fit within the 2SLGBTQIA+ community at home. Fortunately, there&#x27;s more awareness in the community than when I was growing up, and more people who are out and proud, though it&#x27;s still pretty lonely. I celebrated my first Pride week at home this year, which was amazing. </p><p>I&#x27;ve still only been back in my hometown for several months, and there are still a lot of things up in the air. </p><p>I hope to be able to live a fulfilling life here in the Big Land as my authentic self — but only time will tell.</p><p><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador"><em><u><strong>Read more articles from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador</strong></u></em><img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a></p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
