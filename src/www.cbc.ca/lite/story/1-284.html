Construction on the garage would also include landscaping on its roof to replace the lost green space.</p><p>&quot;It had long been promised to the community, with respect to that green space, the parking would be underground,&quot; Wright said. </p><p>But the cost to bury the garage is around $250 million, said Kitchissippi Coun. Jeff Leiper, and no one&#x27;s offering to pay. </p><p>The above-ground garage will also cut off a popular cycling route, Leiper said. And while the rooftop park might be embraced by staff and hospital visitors, the public likely won&#x27;t use it the same way they do now.</p><p>&quot;It seems experimental. And that&#x27;s a bit disconcerting, because if the experiment fails, you&#x27;ve lost a very large swath of green space,&quot; Wright said. </p><p>The plan says making the park inviting to the public will be worked out at a later date — as will how the hospital connects to a future LRT station at Dow&#x27;s Lake.</p><p>Wright and Leiper want to ensure the connection will be convenient enough that staff and visitors will use it and not overwhelm the available parking.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Jeff Leiper"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Jeff Leiper</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Kitchissippi Coun. Jeff Leiper says unless his concerns about the above-ground parking garage and the LRT connection are addressed, he&#x27;ll be voting against the Civic campus plan.  (Ahmar Khan/CBC News)</p></div></div></p><h2>Councillor to vote against plan as is </h2><p>Leiper, who is on the planning committee, told CBC he&#x27;d vote against the plan unless his worries around the garage and the LRT connection can be resolved. </p><p>In comments collected in the city&#x27;s report, Leiper urged his colleagues to use their power to push for a better solution. Even so, he said he&#x27;s fairly certain councillors without a local stake in the project will push it through because of the cost of burying the garage.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.3879359">Civic hospital process the worst way to get to a fine decision</a></li></ul></p><p>Planning committee is expected to do two things Oct. 1: review the site plan and lift what&#x27;s called a &quot;holding provision&quot; on the planning. </p><p>Typically, site plans do not need to go through council; once the area is zoned for a project, city staff handle approvals from there. </p><p>However, this project is one of the city&#x27;s largest, so when zoning was approved in 2018 council added the condition that the plan return to council at this stage. </p><p>City staff recommend that once council nails down the master plan, the major issues will have been resolved and approval authority can be returned to them.</p><p>Councillors can opt to have phases of the decades-long project sent back to planning committee for more debate, however, as they come up. </p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
