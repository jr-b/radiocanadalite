(Chris Walker/CBC)</p></div></div></p><h2>&#x27;An intimidation tactic&#x27;</h2><p>David Lindsay, a prominent anti-vaccine mandate protester in Kelowna, B.C., is also a well-known follower of the Freemen-on-the-land ideology, <a href="https://albertalawreview.com/index.php/ALR/article/view/422">according to legal scholars<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a>, and has used rallies in the Okanagan to spread it. CBC News reached out to Lindsay for comment but did not hear back in time for publication.</p><p>The convoluted legal principles being spread by Lindsay and others arose in the white supremacist Posse Comitatus movement in the United States in the early 1970s, according to Helmut-Harry Loewen, a retired sociologist in Winnipeg and an expert on the Freemen. </p><p>Loewen says they espouse a radical interpretation of the relationship between citizens and government, claiming that explicit individual consent is required for every bureaucratic interaction — from speeding tickets, to taxes, to criminal charges, to public health measures.</p><p>When adherents encounter law enforcement, they exclaim &quot;I do not consent,&quot; which they claim frees them from legal obligations. (It doesn&#x27;t, according to lawyers.)</p><p>That line has been adopted by some anti-vaccine activists — appearing everywhere from protest signs to frames on Facebook profiles, though it isn&#x27;t always clear whether those activists follow Freemen ideology or have, perhaps, just borrowed the phrase. </p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | ANTI-VACCINE FACEBOOK FRAME"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | ANTI-VACCINE FACEBOOK FRAME</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Language similar to that of the Freemen has been adopted by some anti-vaccine activists — appearing on protest signs and frames on Facebook profiles.  (Facebook)</p></div></div></p><p>According to Hodge, the most dedicated Freemen followers issue reams of bogus legal documents in the belief that once the true law is recognized, public officials will be held accountable.</p><p>In British Columbia, activists have insisted on hand-delivering so-called &quot;notices of liability&quot; to public officials, including mayors, city councillors and school principals. </p><p>The recent incursion into a school was &quot;a dramatic escalation,&quot; said Hodge, and indicates that activists are willing to breach previously sacrosanct public spaces. </p><p>&quot;This is an intimidation tactic,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;They see themselves as the only legitimate law enforcement around because they perceive everybody else to be puppets or stooges or in on the conspiracy.&quot;</p><h2>&#x27;Vexatious litigants&#x27;</h2><p>The legal profession takes a dim view of such tactics.</p><p>&quot;People delivering notices of liability might as well be delivering their grocery list,&quot; said Warman. &quot;These documents are 100 per cent false. These have never worked and have never been accepted in any court.&quot;</p><p>Canadian courts have repeatedly ruled against such pseudo-legal arguments and have deemed many Freemen to be &quot;vexatious litigants,&quot; meaning they need special dispensation from the courts to file lawsuits. </p><p>Followers of pseudo-law have a pattern of escalation, according to both Hodge and Warman.</p><p>&quot;They don&#x27;t just post things on Facebook saying, &#x27;I do not consent,&#x27;&quot; said Hodge. &quot;First, they&#x27;re declaring the government unconstitutional, then it&#x27;s issuing false notices, then they&#x27;re making citizen arrests, and then it escalates into violence.&quot;</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6184147">Doors remain locked at Salmon Arm schools after anti-vaccine protest</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6161817">Reports of assault, verbal abuse as thousands protest vaccine passports outside hospitals across B.C.</a></li></ul></p><p>&quot;These theories may run away faster than the truth,&quot; said Warman. &quot;It&#x27;s important to deal with [extremism] at the lowest possible level before it grows. It starts with education and debunking.&quot;</p><p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6186744">Quebec passed a law</a> meant to keep protests away from schools and hospitals. B.C. Premier John Horgan said last week that B.C. is looking to do the same.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s something that we don&#x27;t do lightly but we do in the interests of the vast majority of British Columbians who want to know that they can go about their business free from intolerance of a select few,&quot; he said.</p><p><em><strong>LISTEN | Radicalization among protesters:</strong></em> </p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Media Audio | Experts warn of radicalization of anti-vaccine movement"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Media Audio | Experts warn of radicalization of anti-vaccine movement</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: A bizarre pseudolegal theory is spreading through the anti-vaccine movement.
