Christian is just a two-way forward where he knows where to go, the right areas, always in the right spots.</p><p>&quot;After the first and second (periods), I knew where he was gonna be in the third. It&#x27;s very cool to have that after a couple of periods to already know how he&#x27;s gonna play and where he&#x27;s gonna be.&quot;</p><p><em><strong>WATCH | Christian Dvorak scores his 1st goal as a Canadien:</strong></em></p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Media Video | Habs&#x27; Dvorak scores on sweet passing play in victory over Leafs"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Media Video | Habs&#x27; Dvorak scores on sweet passing play in victory over Leafs</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Forward Christian Dvorak records a goal and three assists as Montreal defeats Toronto 5-2. Dvorak was acquired by the Canadiens in a off-season trade with the Arizona Coyotes. </p></div></div></p><p>Michael Pezzetta also scored twice for the Habs, including an empty-net goal.</p><p>The Canadiens acquired Dvorak from the Arizona Coyotes earlier this month in exchange for two picks, including a first-round selection, in next year&#x27;s draft.</p><p>Even after one pre-season game, Drouin feels their new line combo shows a lot of promise. They&#x27;ll need to convince head coach Dominique Ducharme their trio deserves to stay intact.</p><p>&quot;The coach will decide who we&#x27;ll play with and what the lines will be,&quot; Drouin said. &quot;But I think we like playing together since the start of camp and if we want to keep it like that, it&#x27;s up to us to force Dominque&#x27;s hand and keep this line the way it is. We had a good first game so we need to keep it up.&quot;</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6189888">Maple Leafs take down Canadiens in pre-season action as fans return to Scotiabank Arena</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6185884">It&#x27;s hockey season — here&#x27;s a quick NHL catchup</a></li></ul></p><p>Ducharme thought the line made a good first impression in its first outing.</p><p>&quot;They had good moments in the offensive zone,&quot; Ducharme said. &quot;When we were in the defensive zone or when we would lose the puck, they were good enough to work with our defencemen to be on top of the opposition.&quot;</p><p>Jake Allen stopped all 15 shots he faced in Montreal&#x27;s net before giving way to Kevin Poulin, who turned away 20 of 22.</p><p>David Kampf with a short-handed goal and Ondrej Kase scored for Toronto. Toronto&#x27;s Jack Campbell allowed three goals on 12 shots over half a game.</p><p>Reliever Petr Mrazek turned away seven of eight shots. Mrazek denied Anderson a hat trick with a glove save late in the third period.</p><h2>Guhle makes his debut</h2><p>Defenceman Kaiden Guhle, the teenager from Sherwood Park, Alta., led the Habs in ice time with 23 minutes 44 seconds in his debut.</p><p>&quot;Obviously there&#x27;s a little bit of nerves, but this is where you want to be,&quot; Guhle said. &quot;There were a bit of nerves but I was more excited than anything. I was waiting for this for about a year now, ever since I got drafted. More excited than nerves.&quot;</p><p>Playing alongside Montreal newcomer David Savard, Guhle made an impact blocking a shot in the second period and finishing a penalty-kill shift with a body check.</p><p>&quot;He&#x27;s physical. You can tell that he&#x27;s not scared to sacrifice himself and block a shot,&quot; Ducharme said. &quot;Defensively there were a lot of good things. Offensively, he was efficient with his first passes so it&#x27;s a good game from him.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | HKN Maple Leafs Canadiens 20210927"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | HKN Maple Leafs Canadiens 20210927</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Toronto Maple Leafs goaltender Petr Mrazek stops Montreal Canadiens&#x27; Josh Anderson during the second period.

Anderson and Dvorak each scored power-play goals.</p><p>Pezzetta scored even-strength to make it 3-0 near the midway point of the second.</p><p>Poulin, who had just replaced Allen, turned the puck over to Toronto&#x27;s Kampf for an easy short-handed goal at 11:15.</p><p>Anderson produced a second power-play goal in the period.</p><p>Kase cut the deficit to two on a feed from Morgan Reilly just before the intermission, but Toronto didn&#x27;t score again in the game.</p><h2>Canucks down Flames 4-2 in pre-season action</h2><p>J.T.

(Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)</p></div></div></p><p>Canucks head coach Travis Green liked Ekman-Larsson&#x27;s game.</p><p>&quot;I really thought he took charge tonight, played with a lot of energy, had a lot of bite in his game, too, which you always like,&quot; he said.</p><p>Calgary&#x27;s goals came from Dillon Dube and Connor Mackey.</p><p>Michael DiPietro — who spent much of last season on the Canucks&#x27; taxi squad — was solid in net for Vancouver with 25 saves.</p><p>&quot;I thought (DiPietro) stood tall, especially in the six-on-five. They probably had, I don&#x27;t know, seven or eight shots in the last three minutes there with the goalie out,&quot; Green said. &quot;And I thought he looked solid tonight.&quot;</p><p>DiPietro spent much of last season on the Canucks&#x27; taxi squad and said it felt good to get back into a full game.</p><p>&quot;I think heading into the game, all I was focusing on was having a good start, trying to get my feet and hopefully kind of role from there,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;It was just really fun to get a full 60 and get back playing a full game.&quot;</p><p>Adam Werner stopped 13-of-16 shots for the Flames before being replaced midway through the second period. Daniel Vladar had 12 saves in relief.</p><h2>Flames attempt late comeback</h2><p>The Canucks came into Monday&#x27;s matchup after opening the pre-season with a 5-3 loss to the Seattle Kraken in Spokane, Wash., on Sunday. The Edmonton Oilers blanked the Flames 4-0 in Calgary the same night.</p><p>Vancouver jumped out to a three-goal lead Monday but the Flames battled back with two strikes of their own in the second frame.</p><p>Pearson gave the Canucks some insurance 13:31 into the third period, picking up a drop pass from Ekman-Larsson and riffling it in past Vladar to make it 4-2.</p><p>The Flames pulled the goalie in a bid to make a late comeback but couldn&#x27;t finish with the extra attacker.</p><p>Mackey cut Calgary&#x27;s deficit to 3-2 with less than a minute to go in the second period, sneaking a shot past Di Pietro from the blue line.</p><p>The Flames&#x27; first tally of the night came on a two-man advantage earlier in the frame.</p><h2>Power-play goals propel Vancouver</h2><p>Canucks captain Bo Horvat was sent to the box for cross checking at 10:59 and his teammates steadily worked to kill off the penalty until defenceman Oliver Ekman-Larsson was sanctioned for the same offence in front of the net. Boos emanated from the crowd as the Flames were given 23 seconds of five-on-three hockey.</p><p>Dube scored 11 seconds in with a long bomb through DiPietro&#x27;s legs.</p><p>The Flames were 1-for-3 on the power play Monday, while the Canucks went 2-for-3 with the man advantage.</p><p>A pair of power-play goals helped Vancouver to a 3-0 lead after the first period.</p><p>Calgary&#x27;s Andrew Mangiapane was called for cross-checking at the Canuck&#x27;s bench 15:18 into the opening frame and the home team wasted little time in capitalizing.</p><p>A scramble in front of the Flames&#x27; net saw Horvat blast a shot at Werner and the rebound pop out to Miller, who fired it back in over the past the netminder at 15:34.</p><p>Three minutes earlier, Vancouver&#x27;s Jonah Gadjovich streaked deep into Calgary territory, out waited a sprawled out Juuso Valimaki, then dished the puck to Wouters from the goal line. The 21-year-old forward popped a shot in from the low slot to give the Canucks a 2-0 lead.</p><h2>Ekman-Larsson gets 2 points</h2><p>A pair of new additions teamed up for Vancouver&#x27;s first strike of the night after Flames centre Glenn Gawdin was called for high-sticking 1:41 into the game.</p><p>Stationed at the top of the slot, Garland sent a shot screaming through heavy traffic and found the back of the net to open the scoring at 2:28.</p><p>Ekman-Larsson was credited with an assist on the play.</p><p>Arizona dealt the duo to Vancouver in July in exchange for a first-round pick in the 2021 NHL entry draft. The Coyotes also received veteran forwards Jay Beagle, Loui Eriksson and Antoine Roussel in the deal, as well as the Canucks&#x27; second-round pick in 2022 and its seventh-round pick in 2023.</p><p>The Flames are set to host the Seattle Kraken Wednesday. The Canucks get a brief reprieve before heading to Alberta for a rematch with Calgary on Friday. </p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
