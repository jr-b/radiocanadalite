Hospitals there are overwhelmed, and the head of the Alberta Medical Association says major components of triage have already started.</p><p>Chagla noted that Alberta&#x27;s vaccination rate is not substantially lower than Ontario&#x27;s. What he sees as the major reason for Ontario&#x27;s relatively lower numbers is the different approach to public health measures.</p><p>In July, Alberta lifted its restrictions — including gathering limits and a mask mandate — while in Ontario a few weeks later, the government announced that it would delay any further lifting of restrictions. Masks were still going to be required even when the province moved out of Step 3 of its reopening.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6188331">Few enforcement incidents reported in first days of Ontario vaccine certificates</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6189320">Ontario increases sporting events capacity, ahead of baseball playoffs, NHL season</a></li></ul></p><p>Masks certainly help, Chagla said, but it also matters what signal a government is sending, whether the pandemic is being treated as over.</p><p>&quot;I think again, not getting to a point where there were complete decompression of all the rules, treating COVID as if it was normal, I think it again kept that foot on the gas to continue vaccinating even through the summer aggressively, using every last mile effort to get it out there,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;Keeping some of these precautions on I think helps also with that behavioural piece about people still taking it seriously and not creating the opportunities for transmission.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  |  Beate Sander"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  |  Beate Sander</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Beate Sander, co-chair of Ontario&#x27;s modelling consensus table and a professor at the University of Toronto, says the province has likely not yet seen the rise in cases that schools will spark.   (Radio-Canada)</p></div></div></p><p>Beate Sander, co-chair of the province&#x27;s modelling consensus table, said she would have expected to see more cases by now, but that doesn&#x27;t mean a bump won&#x27;t materialize in a few weeks.</p><p>&quot;The situation is so very fragile,&quot; said Sander, a professor at the University of Toronto&#x27;s Dalla Lana School of Public Health.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s stable, it&#x27;s not exactly decreasing. So things could turn really quickly. You just need to look at Alberta, to look at how quickly things could change.&quot;</p><h2>Colder weather will likely drive transmission</h2><p>Sander said Ontario has likely not yet seen the rise in cases that schools will spark. In-person classes have been in session again for a little over two weeks, but Sander said because most of a child&#x27;s contacts — such as their parents — are likely vaccinated, if a child gets COVID-19, it would take the virus longer to find someone else to infect.</p><p>&quot;The rate of infection has been increasing quite a lot in the five-to-11-year-old kids,&quot; Sander said.</p><p>&quot;Something is growing under the surface, and because it&#x27;s relatively small numbers compared to the overall population, it&#x27;s going to take a while to go through.&quot;</p><p>The colder weather will likely also force more gatherings and activities indoors and drive transmission, the experts said.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6187613">U.S. vaccination requirement for air passengers worries Canadians with mixed vaccines</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6190083">Coronavirus: What&#x27;s happening in Canada and around the world on Sunday</a></li></ul></p><p>&quot;We&#x27;re just right at that point where things could flip and we could be out of balance,&quot; Sander said. &quot;We do not want to open up anything else.&quot;</p><p>Moore said he is still expecting a difficult winter. &quot;I have seen modelling where we have a significant rise in January and February after the Christmas holidays, and that is disconcerting,&quot; he said.</p><p>A bit of optimism is good to have, Chagla said, but it&#x27;s still important to continue doing everything that has led Ontario to this point.</p><p>&quot;There&#x27;s a lot of factors that probably say we&#x27;re going to come out on the other side towards the late winter, early spring and start getting back to a true normal, but there&#x27;s still variants,&quot; he said. &quot;There&#x27;s still a lot of things that could go wrong.&quot;</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
