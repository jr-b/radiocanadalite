The problem is, the U.S. has yet to approve mixing COVID-19 vaccines.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m really worried about this U.S. policy,&quot; said Cathy Hiuser of Ancaster, Ont., who has one dose of COVISHIELD (a brand of AstraZeneca) and one dose of Pfizer. She has booked a trip to Maui, departing Nov. 7.</p><p>&quot;I don&#x27;t even know if I&#x27;ll be able to go across the border,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#x27;s a problem.&quot;</p><p>At the same time as the U.S. introduces its vaccine requirement, the country will lift its travel ban on air passengers entering from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/from-other-countries.html"><u>a list of</u><img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> dozens of red-flagged countries.</p><p>&quot;We&#x27;ll be putting in place strict protocols to prevent the spread of COVID-19 from passengers flying internationally into the United States,&quot; said White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday. </p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Peel Vax Van"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Peel Vax Van</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Millions of Canadians received mixed COVID-19 vaccine doses after Canada updated its vaccine guidelines in June.

But she&#x27;s speaking publicly about it in the hopes the Canadian government will pressure the U.S. to accept mixed vaccines. </p><p>&quot;Somebody&#x27;s got to take this bull by the horns,&quot; she said. &quot;There&#x27;s got to be something that can be done.&quot;</p><p><em><strong>WATCH | Travellers with mixed vaccines say they can&#x27;t board some cruises: </strong></em><div><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Media Video | Travellers with mixed vaccines say they can&#x27;t board some cruises"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Media Video | Travellers with mixed vaccines say they can&#x27;t board some cruises</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Many Canadians who have received mixed doses of a COVID-19 vaccine are facing travel issues in countries that don&#x27;t recognize them as being fully vaccinated.
