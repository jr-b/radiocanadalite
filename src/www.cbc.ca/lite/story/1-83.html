He added that since the certificate program went into on Sept. 22, there have been only &quot;very minimal&quot; instances of business owners or employees having to call police for assistance with patrons.</p><p>McNaughton announced 100 additional health and safety inspectors were graduating Monday and would be visiting workplaces in construction, industrial and health-care settings.
