(Hudsonsbay/Instagram)</p></div></div></p><p>A Hudson&#x27;s Bay spokesperson told CBC News that the company did not mean to cause any confusion about the sale of the shirts and said they were made available for purchase in collaboration with the Orange Shirt Society, a B.C.-based non-profit that works to create awareness of the effects of residential schools.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6184547">National Day for Truth and Reconciliation should be a solemn day to reflect, says author</a></li></ul></p><p>All of the proceeds from the sale of the orange shirts will go to the non-profit &quot;to support their work to commemorate the residential school experience, to witness and honour the healing journey of the survivors and their families, and to the ongoing process of reconciliation,&quot; the spokesperson said in a statement on Saturday.</p><h2>Role in colonization</h2><p>The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Co., one of the oldest companies in Canada, was established long before Canada even became a country in 1867. Prior to that, the company actually served as a de facto government in parts of North America.</p><p>&quot;If we look at the area where the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Co. kind of took over and set up all their trading posts and stuff, it&#x27;s all Indigenous land,&quot; said Lanouette, who became interested in the history of the company as a teen.</p><p>In 1868, a huge chunk of land owned by the company was sold to the Dominion of Canada under the Rupert&#x27;s Land Act, which resulted in a large part of the Prairies — including Manitoba — joining Canada.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6093299">He created a logo to honour residential school victims.
