It would seem the public&#x27;s anger at the Alberta premier has bled into the federal arena.</p><p>Normally, federal Liberal candidates in Alberta only have a chance to win a seat when their party is clearly headed toward a majority government — as it was in 2015 when Liberals won four seats.</p><ul>   <li> <p><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6182352"><strong>Alberta&#x27;s proof-of-vaccination program begins today.

Conservatives blamed Klein for allowing the Liberals to hang on to power with a minority government.</p><p>Klein&#x27;s popularity, already beginning to weaken, began a free fall. He managed to win the Alberta election in November 2004 but lost 11 seats and 200,000 votes compared to the 2001 election.</p><p>Klein&#x27;s days were numbered and, after receiving a humiliating 55 per cent support in a leadership review in March of 2006, he had no choice but to retire earlier than planned.</p><p>Kenney, on the other hand, is not supposed to face a leadership review until late next year.</p><p>However, there is now a move afoot by some UCP constituency associations to force a review early next year to give the party time to choose a new leader before the next election scheduled for the spring of 2023.</p><p>The knives are out for Kenney and they&#x27;re coming from all directions.</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
