(Evan Mitsui/CBC)</p></div></div></p><p>Ontario&#x27;s Chief Medical Officer Dr. Kieran Moore told reporters Friday that large-scale antigen testing doesn&#x27;t significantly limit the spread of COVID-19 and can produce false positives that lead to people getting unnecessary PCR tests and burdening labs.</p><p>&quot;It would be difficult for us to test two million children every day or twice a week or three times a week,&quot; Moore said. </p><p>However, he said the province is considering using rapid tests in schools where the community rate is high, over 100 cases per 100,000 people. </p><p>The province will also require all school staff not fully vaccinated to regularly complete rapid tests and does supply them to businesses and other workplaces. </p><p>Some parents started <a href="https://community.sumofus.org/petition/15d9fdd0-e507-49f9-9e41-8d36b85a04fe/?source=copy">an online petition<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> calling for the province to provide rapid testing to all kids not yet eligible for vaccination that has reached 2,000 signatures.</p><h2>Experts support rapid testing</h2><p>The Earl Beatty school program&#x27;s rapid antigen tests are intended for students who don&#x27;t have any COVID-19 symptoms or known exposures, said Kaufman. That&#x27;s different than <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6155953">the take-home testing kits</a> that three hospitals are supplying across city schools, which are only for kids showing symptoms or experienced a high-risk exposure.</p><p>The rapid tests, while less reliable, display results within 15 minutes at home, according to Stay Safe guidelines. </p><p>If a student tests positive, parents are advised to report the result to Michael Garron Hospital and get a lab-based test, Kaufman said.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Isaac Bogoch"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Isaac Bogoch</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Dr. Isaac Bogoch is an infectious disease specialist at Toronto General Hospital.   (CBC)</p></div></div></p><p>Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist with Toronto&#x27;s University Health Network, is one of many experts who say rapid testing has a role to play in making indoor spaces like schools safer. </p><p>&quot;They&#x27;re really there to answer the question: &#x27;Am I contagious with the virus right now?&#x27;&quot; Bogoch said.</p><p>&quot;Of course, they&#x27;re not perfect, but they&#x27;re pretty good at doing it and if they were distributed among families, I think we could do a lot of good with those tests.&quot; </p><p>Kaufman said he realizes parents at Earl Beatty are in a privileged position, with the time and resources to run the program with help from Stay Safe, while other communities may need more help from their school boards, public health units or the province to get access to similar testing.</p><p>But the interest exists. Kaufman said every day he hears from parents across the province and country who want to start something similar.</p><p>&quot;Nor every parent group who wants these tests can get them,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;People can&#x27;t drive from Ottawa to Waterloo to pick up a test, which is what we&#x27;re hearing. And even the fact that I have to drive from Toronto to pick up the tests is kind of crazy.&quot;</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
