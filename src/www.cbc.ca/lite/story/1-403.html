Later, when the hot spring dried up, the mud hardened into stone, preserving the prints over time. </p><p>The rocks have been dated to between 169,000 and 226,000 years ago. It is not known exactly who the people were that lived on the Tibetan Plateau at that time, but one possibility is the Denisovans, a branch of our early ancestors who lived in Asia and resembled modern humans.

The authors describe the medium the prints are in <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2021/09/hand-and-footprint-art-dates-mid-ice-age">as intentionally altered<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a>, which they suggest could have been a kind of performance to show like, &quot;Hey, look at me, I&#x27;ve made my handprints over these footprints.&quot;</p><p>Or perhaps these impressions represent the human desire to leave marks behind on the landscape that say, &quot;I was here.&quot; It&#x27;s a tradition that continues today with graffiti on walls in back alleys and famous actors and actresses who leave impressions of their hands and feet in cement along Hollywood Boulevard.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | PEOPLE-JERRY LEWIS/"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | PEOPLE-JERRY LEWIS/</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: A makeshift memorial appeared for late comedian, actor and legendary entertainer Jerry Lewis around his hand and feet prints on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles when he died in 2017.

The oldest stencil-type handprints, where a hand is placed on a wall and coloured powder is blown around it to make an outline, have been found along with other cave paintings in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abd4648">Sulawesi, Indonesia<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> and <a href="https://www.science.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1219957">El Castillo, Spain<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> dating back between 40,000 to 45,000 years ago. This is known as parietal art because it is not meant to be moved, unlike paintings or statues that can be displayed anywhere and traded. And the <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-archaeological-journal/article/abs/40000yearold-female-figurine-of-hohle-fels-previous-assumptions-and-new-perspectives/8F9E1A4E3BEAFFCE9881252445314469">oldest statues<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> also only go back to about the same time period.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | INDONESIA-ART/"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | INDONESIA-ART/</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: A cave painting dating back to nearly 44,000 years was seen in a limestone cave in South Sulawesi, Indonesia.

But the question of whether the impressions are art or not is almost moot because handprints and footprints from the deep past provide valuable scientific information.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | old art hand and foot prints"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | old art hand and foot prints</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: An international team of researchers describe ancient hand and footprints made deliberately which they argue represent art.

It is up to the scientists to infer, to fill in the gaps and try to determine what the people were actually like. But handprints are the direct signature of a person.</p><p>Tourists on Hollywood Boulevard squat down to place their hands in the prints of their favourite actors to get a sense of what it might be like to shake their hand, sort of a virtual handshake. Imagine a handshake that reaches across millennia into an actual moment in time, to a couple of kids who were just messing in the mud.</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
