They are being accompanied by Dominic Barton, Canada&#x27;s ambassador to China.</p><p>The so-called two Michaels were detained in what is widely considered a retaliatory act after the Chinese tech executive Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Vancouver on Dec. 1, 2018, at the request of the U.S. government.</p><p>Meng reached a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. government earlier Friday, setting off a quick chain of events that saw her extradition case dropped by a B.C. court and concluded with her departure from the Vancouver airport, also about 7:30 p.m. ET.</p><p><em><strong>WATCH | Extradition case against Meng Wanzhou ends:</strong></em></p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Media Video | Extradition case against Meng Wanzhou ends"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Media Video | Extradition case against Meng Wanzhou ends</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Canada has dropped its extradition case against Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou after she entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S., resolving that case.

He also did not answer exactly how their release came about.</p><p>&quot;There is going to be time for analysis and reflection in the coming days and weeks, but the fact of the matter is, I know Canadians will be incredibly happy to know right now, this Friday night, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor are on a plane and they&#x27;re coming home,&quot; he told reporters in Parliament&#x27;s West Block building.</p><h2>Timing proves link between cases: former diplomats</h2><p>Spavor, an entrepreneur who worked in North Korea and China, was found guilty of spying and sentenced to 11 years in prison and deportation by a Chinese court in August.</p><p>The trial for Kovrig, a diplomat, concluded in March, but he had not yet been sentenced.</p><p>Both men were initially detained on Dec. 10, 2018, 10 days after Meng&#x27;s arrest in Vancouver.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | 1231869481"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | 1231869481</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Canadian Embassy Charge d&#x27;Affaires Jim Nickel, centre, demonstrated alongside other diplomats from Canada&#x27;s allies after they were denied entry to Michael Kovrig&#x27;s trial in March.

Blinken said in a statement that his government welcomes the return of Spavor and Kovrig &quot;after more than two and a half years of arbitrary detention.&quot;</p><h2>Meng reaches deferred prosecution agreement</h2><p>As part of her arrangement with U.S. prosecutors, Meng pleaded not guilty in a court Friday to multiple fraud charges.</p><p>The Huawei chief financial officer entered the plea during a virtual appearance in a New York courtroom. She was charged with bank fraud, wire fraud and conspiracies to commit bank and wire fraud more than two and a half years ago.</p><p>The agreed statement of facts from Friday&#x27;s U.S. court appearance said that Meng told a global financial institution that a company operating in Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions was a &quot;local partner&quot; of Huawei when in fact it was a subsidiary of Huawei.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | MENG WANZHOU "><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | MENG WANZHOU </p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou reads a statement outside the B.C.

Spavor and Kovrig were held in Chinese prisons during the same period.</p><p>Meng read from a prepared statement, following what was likely her last appearance in a B.C. court, in which she thanked the Canadian government &quot;for upholding the rule of law.&quot;</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
