</p></div></div></div><div><p>German Social Democrat Olaf Scholz vowed on Monday to strengthen the European Union and keep up the transatlantic partnership in a three-way coalition government he hopes to form by Christmas to take over from Angela Merkel&#x27;s conservatives.</p><p>Scholz&#x27;s Social Democratic Party (SPD) came first in Sunday&#x27;s national parliamentary election, just ahead of the conservatives, and aim to lead a government for the first time since 2005 in a coalition with the Greens and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP).</p><p>Scholz, 63, projected a sense of calm assurance when asked whether the close election result and the prospect of prolonged coalition negotiations sent a message of instability in Germany to its European partners.</p><p>&quot;Germany always has coalition governments and it was always stable,&quot; he said in fluent English, standing beside a statue of Willy Brandt, a Cold War-era SPD chancellor awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for fostering dialogue between East and West.</p><h2>Merkel&#x27;s party narrowly defeated</h2><p>The centre-left SPD won the biggest share of the vote in Sunday&#x27;s election, narrowly beating outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel&#x27;s centre-right Union bloc in a closely fought race that will determine who succeeds the longtime leader at the helm of Europe&#x27;s biggest economy.</p><p>Despite getting its worst-ever result in a federal contest, the Union bloc said it, too, would reach out to smaller parties to discuss forming a government, while Merkel stays on in a caretaker role until a successor is sworn in.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5011158">&#x27;The Empress of Europe&#x27; or &#x27;Frau Nein&#x27;?

No winning party in a German national election had previously taken less than 31 per cent of the vote.</p><p>Armin Laschet, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia state who outmanoeuvred a more popular rival to secure the nomination of Merkel&#x27;s Union bloc, had struggled to motivate the party&#x27;s base and suffered a series of missteps.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Germany Election"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Germany Election</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Olaf Scholz, leader of the Social Democrats, waves to supporters in Berlin on Sunday.

But he added that with Merkel departing after 16 years in power, &quot;no one had an incumbent bonus in this election.&quot;</p><p>Laschet told supporters that &quot;we will do everything we can to form a government under the Union&#x27;s leadership, because Germany now needs a coalition for the future that modernizes our country.&quot;</p><h2>Rivals to court smaller parties</h2><p>Both Laschet and Scholz will be courting the same two parties: the environmentalist Greens, who were third with 14.8 per cent, and the pro-business Free Democrats, who took 11.5 per cent of the vote.</p><p>The Greens traditionally lean toward the Social Democrats and the Free Democrats toward the Union, but neither ruled out going the other way.</p><p>The other option was a repeat of the outgoing &quot;grand coalition&quot; of the Union and Social Democrats that has run Germany for 12 of Merkel&#x27;s 16 years in power, but there was little obvious appetite for that after years of government squabbling.</p><p>&quot;Everyone thinks that ... this &#x27;grand coalition&#x27; isn&#x27;t promising for the future, regardless of who is No. 1 and No. 2,&quot; Laschet said. &quot;We need a real new beginning.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | APTOPIX Germany Election"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | APTOPIX Germany Election</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: German Chancellor Angela Merkel and candidate Armin Laschet speak to fellow Christian Democratic Union party members in Berlin on Sunday.

The far-right Alternative for Germany — which no one else wants to work with — received 10.3 per cent.
