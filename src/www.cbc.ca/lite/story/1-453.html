That&#x27;s considered an international signal of distress. And where there is no real distress, there is sacrilege to the flag, by using it as political prop. </p><p>The irony is that these are often the very same people who will scream about sitting or kneeling during a national anthem.</p><h2>&#x27;Co-opted what veterans think&#x27;</h2><p>Where has this idea about veterans and anthems come from? What some veterans refer to as the &quot;thank-you-for-your-service&quot; people — those who have never served, but for some reason are hyper-aware of veterans.</p><p>They think they &quot;support veterans&quot; by haranguing people like Skyla, who do anything other than stand at rigid attention during the anthem. Really, they&#x27;ve co-opted what veterans think. </p><p>I&#x27;m here to tell you that this veteran thinks Skyla is a brave young Canadian for her stand.  </p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.3742515">Colin Kaepernick saluted by some military veterans</a></li></ul></p><p>In addition to being a veteran of the Canadian Forces, I&#x27;m also a veteran of 20 years of service with fire and rescue. There, I regularly saw courage. It made me think a lot about courage in all its forms.  </p><p>Certainly there&#x27;s the courage in being able to go into a burning building — or toward combat.</p><p>But there&#x27;s also a profound courage demonstrated by those who take actions that may not be understood by all who observe them. That takes guts. That takes courage.</p><p>And young Skyla demonstrated with her actions that she has a courage beyond her years to take the seat. </p><blockquote class="pullquote">  The problem isn&#x27;t Skyla. The problem is that we&#x27;ve let things get to where they are.   <cite class="pullquote-source">- Bruce Marshall</cite> </blockquote><p>Good Canadians have realized that things are terribly wrong in our relationship with First Nations. </p><p>This isn&#x27;t history. It&#x27;s now. </p><p>Clean water and dozens of other things that we take for granted in Canadian cities are something our government deems First Nations not worthy of.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6180462">Despite pledge to end drinking water advisories, these 2 Manitoba First Nations still live under them</a></li></ul></p><p>The basic right to clean water. Something that Canadians go around the world to deliver. But we can&#x27;t do it here at home. Pitiful. Disgusting. Un-Canadian, even I would say. We can&#x27;t continue with this nonsense. </p><p>We stand for the anthem, because we are proud of Canada. But the more I learn about the shabby way that the Canadian Nation treated people from Skyla&#x27;s Nation and other First Nations, even I don&#x27;t stand so proudly anymore. </p><p>And if we have young people like Skyla who are offended and ashamed of the anthem, the problem isn&#x27;t Skyla. The problem is that we&#x27;ve let things get to where they are. </p><p>Maybe that school — or maybe even all of us across the nation — should forgo playing <em>O Canada</em> until reconciliation is real and all Canadians can stand together with pride. Maybe the un-Canadians are the ones who continue to stand while this outrage is real. </p><p>I applaud Skyla for her actions. But also for her forbearance. Because if I had been treated like Skyla and her family, I&#x27;d be doing a lot more than sitting down during the anthem!  </p><p>It&#x27;s incumbent now upon <em>all</em> good Canadians to stand — or sit — with the likes of Skyla, so that one day she&#x27;s proud enough to stand for <em>O Canada</em>. </p><p>Until then, I&#x27;d be honoured to sit through the anthem with her. </p><p>Until then, #ISitWithSkyla.</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
