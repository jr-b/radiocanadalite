She was also a member of the New York Vanderbilts, once the wealthiest family in America.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5178268">Heiress, designer Gloria Vanderbilt dead at 95</a></li></ul></p><p>Cooper and Vanderbilt worked on several projects together in her later years, including a 2016 book of their correspondence, <em>The Rainbow Comes and Goes</em>. That same year, they featured in a two-hour documentary <em>Nothing Left Unsaid, </em>exploring her family history life and in the public eye.</p><p>He returns to that family history in his new book <em>Vanderbilt: The Rise and Fall of An American Dynasty</em>. The book looks at the family&#x27;s troubled history, and explains why for most of his life he did everything possible to distance himself from the name. The book is published this week, co-written with historian and novelist Katherine Howe.</p><h2>Wealth &#x27;infected&#x27; Vanderbilt family: Cooper</h2><p>Cornelius &quot;Commodore&quot; Vanderbilt started the family business in shipping and railroads, and died in 1877 leaving more than $100 million US (equivalent to more than $2 billion US today) behind for his family. His son doubled that fortune, and the family built mansions across New York, making their mark on high society. </p><p>But industry changes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2014/07/14/the-vanderbilts-how-american-royalty-lost-their-crown-jewels/">ate away at the family business<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a>, and an increasing number of Vanderbilts spent lavishly as they vied for shrinking inheritances. After generations of decline, surviving descendants are longer born into the extreme wealth of their predecessors.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Embed  | Miscellaneous"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Embed  | Miscellaneous</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY"> </p></div></div></p><p>Cooper said the Vanderbilts he learned about while writing the book were fascinating, but &quot;a lot of them are irredeemable, a lot of them are awful.&quot;</p><p>The Commodore cared little for his daughters, Cooper said, because they would be married off to other families and their children would not carry the Vanderbilt name. He also despised one of his sons, who had epilepsy and was secretly gay, Cooper said. And the son who eventually inherited everything did so by cheating his father in a business transaction, which impressed him.</p><p>&quot;The pathology that allowed the Commodore to amass all that money, in my view, infected every subsequent generation and not in a good way. It corrupted,&quot; Cooper said.</p><p>Growing up, he didn&#x27;t have much contact with his mother&#x27;s extended family. But he said from what little he knew, they didn&#x27;t seem happy, despite their wealth. Meanwhile his father, who had been raised on a Mississippi farm in the Great Depression, seemed to offer a better role model.</p><p>&quot;If I want an origin story that I carry with me in my secret heart, that&#x27;s the origin story that will help me live a better life,&quot; Cooper said.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.3535191">Anderson Cooper reflects on love, loss and his relationship with mom Gloria Vanderbilt</a></li></ul></p><p>From a young age, his own parents told him he would have to make his own way in the world.</p><p>&quot;There was no pot of gold waiting for me when I turned 21, as most people probably thought there was,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;And I&#x27;m very happy about that. I think I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to do the things I&#x27;ve done if, I think, I had that kind of a cushion.&quot;</p><p>Cooper said he decided to write this book for his one-year-old son, Wyatt, and explore the family he&#x27;s distanced himself from for so long. </p><p>He wants the book to help Wyatt understand his family and his past, and make up his own mind, &quot;knowing all the information, good and bad.&quot;</p><p>He also wants Wyatt to &quot;realize that this is in a very long-ago past, in another world. And his future is his to write.&quot;</p><hr/><p><em>Written by Padraig Moran.
