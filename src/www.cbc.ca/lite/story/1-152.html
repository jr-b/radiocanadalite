Black women make up three per cent of that number, about five per cent are Asian women and one per cent are Latina women.</p><p>These numbers raise an issue of underrepresentation for Lena Thibeh, co-founder of <a href="https://www.bwoss.ca/">BWOSS<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a>, a Waterloo-headquartered non-profit that helps BlPOC women access sales development resources and career development support.</p><p>Thibeh is among several speakers at <a href="https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/the-colourful-side-of-tech-sales-registration-165945444291">a panel discussion Monday evening titled The Colourful Side of Tech Sales<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a>, that aims to put a voice and face to those statistics.</p><p>&quot;How do we humanize that data so it hits home for tech companies and hits home for recruiters where they understand that this is a problem and it&#x27;s unacceptable,&quot; she said.</p><p>Thibeh said tackling the issue of gender diversity starts with holding tech leaders, who often have a bias toward men, accountable and ensuring equity is front and centre.</p><p>&quot;They do not see the value in Black, Indigenous and racialized voices, especially when it comes to women.
