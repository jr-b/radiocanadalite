processing fees that went to DHL.  (Colin Hall/CBC)</p></div></div></div><div><p>Michelle Sinclair knew her son Aodhan only wanted one thing for this 10th birthday — a football jersey from his favourite team in Dublin, just like the one his dad owns.</p><p>So the Calgary mom ordered it online last month and paid $24 for shipment to Canada, using one of the biggest courier companies in the world — DHL, which operates in 220 countries and is known for its bright yellow planes and trucks with bold red lettering.</p><p>But two days later DHL emailed Sinclair, saying she had to pay another $23 before the package could be delivered to her door.</p><p>&quot;My item is being held for ransom,&quot; Sinclair told Go Public. &quot;It seems a little dirty … [to wait] until you have my package to tell me about all these hidden fees.&quot;</p><p>Sinclair is joining a growing chorus of people online who say DHL is using claims of &quot;duty and taxes&quot; to include extra charges that customers feel trapped into paying or risk losing their packages.</p><ul>   <li><strong><strong>Got a story? Contact Erica and the <a href="http://gopublic@cbc.ca/">Go Public<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> team</strong></strong></li>  </ul><p>&quot;This doesn&#x27;t seem to be very pro-consumer,&quot; said Amee Sandhu, a Toronto lawyer who specializes in business law and corporate ethics.</p><p>&quot;I don&#x27;t understand why the corporation would do something like that. The danger is reputational loss. They&#x27;re risking turning off their customers.&quot;</p><h2>Difficult to understand</h2><p>Sinclair says she knew it would cost a little more to have the jersey sent by DHL instead of regular mail, but thought it was worth it.</p><p>&quot;We&#x27;ll get it here quickly and it&#x27;s fine,&quot; she recalled thinking. &quot;At least … that was the plan.&quot;</p><p>She was surprised by that email, announcing in red, capital letters that a payment was required for import duty and tax. She owed a further $23.25.</p><p>When Sinclair inquired why duty and import fees amounted to $23 on a $68 item, a DHL brokerage supervisor told her imports are subject to &quot;duty, taxes, and other customs related charges&quot; and directed her to the website of the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).</p><p>But when Sinclair pressed, she learned that only $5.40 was being charged for GST and the remaining $17 plus tax was a &quot;standard processing fee&quot; DHL was pocketing for completing customs paperwork. There was, in fact, no import duty. <strong> </strong></p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | DHL email"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | DHL email</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Sinclair says this email from DHL is misleading, because most of the $23.25 fee had nothing to do with duty or taxes — it was a &#x27;processing fee&#x27; for the company.  (Submitted by Michelle Sinclair)</p></div></div></p><p>&quot;If it&#x27;s a standard fee, it needs to be told,&quot; said Sinclair. &quot;I&#x27;ve already paid for you to handle my product. So don&#x27;t be sneaky about it.&quot; </p><p>Sandhu also says — in the name of transparency — DHL needs to clearly alert its own customers about its fees.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s quite difficult to understand why they wouldn&#x27;t just put that [prominently] on their website tomorrow,&quot; she said. &quot;It just sort of boggles the mind why it wouldn&#x27;t be made much more clear.&quot; </p><p>Such fees could also be made clear on the sites of retailers who use DHL, say critics.</p><p>Sinclair says there was definitely no mention of additional fees when she bought the jersey, and double-checked by going through the whole ordering process again — stopping only when the site asked for her credit card. </p><h2>Fees widely questioned</h2><p>Anger and frustration over DHL&#x27;s &quot;hidden fees&quot; is rampant online — with discussion boards and websites like dhl-sucks.net featuring customer beefs about getting dinged for extra fees when shipping costs have already been paid. </p><p>&quot;Every package, I need to pay more,&quot; writes an Alberta customer. </p><p>&quot;I paid them out of frustration,&quot; writes another.</p><p>&quot;After I paid, they stated … I need to pay more,&quot; posts another.</p><p><strong><em>WATCH | &#x27;Hidden fees&#x27; dog International courier DHL:</em></strong></p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Media Video | International courier DHL questioned about ‘hidden fees’ | Go Public"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Media Video | International courier DHL questioned about ‘hidden fees’ | Go Public</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: A Calgary mom says international courier DHL should be more transparent about hidden fees on deliveries, which are often labelled duty and tax, but go directly to the company. </p></div></div></p><p>Go Public requested an interview with a DHL spokesperson, which was declined. <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/20498600/statements-dhl-express-canada-ltd.pdf">In a statement<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a>, spokesperson Hazel Valencia wrote that the company understands &quot;there can be some confusion&quot; when it comes to shipping purchased goods.</p><p>DHL processes any customs paperwork, said Valencia, &quot;so recipients are charged a nominal fee&quot; for the service. </p><p>&quot;We believe this is a service that facilitates the transaction of clearance with Customs, saves recipients the trouble of processing paperwork,&quot; wrote Valencia.</p><p>But Sinclair says she would have appreciated a heads up. &quot;We&#x27;re a family of five,&quot; she said. &quot;I can&#x27;t be getting surprised … for something I just don&#x27;t have in the budget.&quot;</p><p>Valencia also said that DHL&#x27;s customs processing fees are outlined online and <a href="https://mydhl.express.dhl/ca/en/ship/customs-services.html">provided a link<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a><em>. </em>But for consumers, that information can be hard to find amid the many pages on several DHL websites that only mention duty and tax payments.</p><p>Valencia did not address Sinclair&#x27;s concerns that the company is not transparent about its processing fee in advance and declined to say whether DHL would take steps to state its charges prominently online or in communications with customers.</p><h2>&#x27;Very underhanded&#x27;</h2><p>George Mulamoottil of Mississauga, Ont., wrote to Go Public saying his shipment of tea left a sour taste in his mouth after DHL tacked on unexpected charges.</p><p>The 88-year-old retired environmental biology professor asked his niece to send a favourite brand of white tea from India last August &quot;because it&#x27;s delicious and organic.&quot;</p><p>DHL said he owed outstanding fees on his $22 item — to the tune of almost $19.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | George Mulamoottil"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | George Mulamoottil</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: George Mulamoottil was told he owed almost $19 for duty and tax on a $22 shipment of tea from India.

When Dawar pressed DHL for more information, he was told there was a &quot;Health Canada&quot; fee, which he later determined actually went to the shipping giant, not the government. He was also charged a processing fee.</p><p>&quot;They tried everything to not tell me these were DHL fees,&quot; said Dawar, who had already paid $100 for shipping.</p><p><div><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Amee Sandhu"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Amee Sandhu</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Lawyer Amee Sandhu says she often sees corporations &#x27;double down&#x27; when consumers get angry, instead of fixing a problem and preventing reputational harm.
