And it&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re scared for our lives or anything, but we are not wanting that backlash to be put on our staff. We don&#x27;t want our staff to be afraid to come to work and deal with that type of confrontation,&quot; co-owner Aleesha Gosling told <em>As It Happens </em>host Carol Off.</p><p>&quot;People were calling us sheep, and [saying] we should be ashamed to live in Canada because ... we are taking away people&#x27;s rights and we&#x27;re discriminating ... we&#x27;re as bad as racists and we should watch our backs and that kind of stuff.&quot;</p><p>Gosling said that the messages made her staff feel unsafe, so she decided to shut down the Firehouse and only reopen once they had a plan.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Langdon Firehouse stage"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Langdon Firehouse stage</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: A view of the stage at the Langdon Firehouse Bar &amp; Grill. The Alberta venue is known for its live music.  (Langdon Firehouse/Instagram)</p></div></div></p><p>Earlier this month, Premier Jason Kenney announced new public health restrictions in Alberta, to try to stem the tide of rising COVID cases.</p><p>However, businesses who ask patrons 12 and up for either proof of vaccination face fewer restrictions, under what the Alberta government calls the voluntary &quot;restriction exemption program.&quot; </p><p>Other than in Calgary, there is currently no mandatory vaccine passport in Alberta. Some residents have expressed confusion about the details of the exemption program, and<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6178020"> how it works</a>.</p><p>&quot;That kind of leaves us in a position where, well, what exactly are we looking at? Are people bringing in a piece of paper? Are people bringing in a card or are people showing us this on our phone?&quot; she said.</p><p>When Gosling asked government agencies, including Alberta Health, they told her to refer to the restrictions online, which said to check for proof of vaccination or a recent negative COVID-19 test.</p><p>But even this question has become complicated — as well as an ethical one for her.</p><p>&quot;Everybody has the right to say, &#x27;I don&#x27;t want to show my medical information.&#x27; And that&#x27;s fine,&quot; Gosling said. &quot;So then you&#x27;re choosing not to come to the restaurant. But don&#x27;t attack us for making the decision that we have to implement this.&quot;</p><p>The Firehouse plans to open its doors again Thursday at 3 p.m. local time, with security guards checking for proof of vaccination and dealing with the patrons who may not comply.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Embed  | Miscellaneous"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Embed  | Miscellaneous</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY"> </p></div></div></p><p>Gosling said that the restaurant is still catching up on its financial losses from lockdowns over the last two years — and that hiring security is an added burden.</p><p>&quot;It says to me that the world has become extremely divided. That people don&#x27;t understand that we don&#x27;t really have a choice ... let&#x27;s close our doors and put the Firehouse out of business, or comply,&quot; she explained.</p><p>&quot;That&#x27;s like, there&#x27;s a gun to your head. You make the choice. [But] it&#x27;s not really a choice.&quot;</p><p>But Gosling thinks it could help if the provincial government stepped in and made vaccine passports mandatory.</p><p>&quot;Maybe some people would be a little bit more understanding, saying, &#x27;Well, we really don&#x27;t have a choice because it is now a bylaw.&quot; </p><p>&quot;But what we&#x27;re feeling is the people that are morally against this are morally against it as a whole, no matter who puts it in place.&quot;</p><hr/><p><em>Written by Mehek Mazhar.
