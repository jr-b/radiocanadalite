I think your real father passed away in 1973 at the age of 47 from a heart attack and I&#x27;m telling you this because of your flying career,&#x27;&quot; Boyd, a former pilot with the Royal Canadian Air Force, told CBC Radio&#x27;s <em>Information Morning</em> on Friday.</p><p>&quot;So it kind of went in one ear and out the other but it stuck with me all these years.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Janet Denyes and Rick Boyd"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Janet Denyes and Rick Boyd</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Half-siblings Janet Denyes and Rick Boyd have already talked about getting together for the holidays in Ontario this year.  (Submitted by Rick Boyd)</p></div></div></p><p>Now 69 and living in St. Albert, Alta., Boyd has finally learned the truth about his lineage.</p><p>In 2019, his wife purchased him an Ancestry DNA kit for Christmas in hopes that it might quell his uncertainty.</p><p>Boyd received the results in February 2020.</p><p>&quot;Right off the top, there was this person named G.W. who was a 100 per cent half-sibling,&quot; Boyd said. &quot;That got my attention.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Media Audio | Long lost siblings, united by a DNA test"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Media Audio | Long lost siblings, united by a DNA test</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: When Rick Boyd, of Alberta, took a DNA test it changed his life by unveiling four secret half-siblings from Nova Scotia. Rick and his new sister share their story. </p></div></div></p><p>It also confirmed what his father had told him so many years ago. </p><p>&quot;I knew I had another father. I knew right there that my dad wasn&#x27;t my dad, so my suspicions were gone,&quot; he said. &quot;I just knew I had to follow this up to find out who this person was. It was overwhelming.&quot;</p><h2>Connecting the dots</h2><p>Before Boyd could even pursue this new half-sibling, he received a message from a researcher on Ancestry who works to connect family members. </p><p>Within four days, the researcher had compared Boyd&#x27;s DNA and that of his potential half-sibling and confirmed their relationship.</p><p>It was then revealed that G.W. was actually <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5727167">former MLA Gordon Wilson</a>, who grew up in the coastal community of Digby, N.S.</p><p>&quot;He said, &#x27;Yeah, you are Gordon&#x27;s half-brother and not only that, he&#x27;s got a brother and you&#x27;ve got two twin sisters, so you&#x27;re not a Boyd. You are in fact a Wilson, but your mother was your mother,&#x27;&quot; Boyd said. </p><p>&quot;So that changed my life right there in that spot.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Zoom call with Wilson family"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Zoom call with Wilson family</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: During their first video call together, Boyd took a screenshot of them, calling it their &#x27;first family photo.&#x27;  (Submitted by Rick Boyd)</p></div></div></p><p>By April, Wilson and Boyd had connected over the phone and they were able to put the pieces of Boyd&#x27;s lineage together.</p><p>He was born in November 1951, only six months after his parents were married. He later discovered that his mother had been dating two men when she became pregnant.</p><p>Boyd was an army brat so he spent his teenage years in Greenwood, N.S., only about 90 kilometres east of Digby where his biological father and four half-siblings were living.</p><p>One of those siblings is Janet Denyes, who now lives in Brighton, Ont.</p><p>&quot;It was a bit shocking, of course, to hear this news and then first thing, we were like, &#x27;OK, when did this happen? When was he born?&#x27; We were trying to map everything together,&quot; Denyes told <em>Information Morning</em>. &quot;It was very exciting.&quot;</p><h2>&#x27;Getting down to Nova Scotia&#x27;</h2><p>Boyd has since gotten to know his siblings, including younger brothers, Gordon and Doug, and twin sisters, Janet and Joanne, over video calls.</p><p>Gordon, Doug and Joanne still live in the Digby area.</p><p>&quot;It was just a welcoming experience from start to finish. There was no trepidation. Our [researcher] had done all the math. I knew I was born two years before my father got married, so there was no impact to my stepmother, who&#x27;s still around,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;So it was a very easy transition. The next step was just getting out of COVID and getting down to Nova Scotia.&quot;</p><p>After 18 long months of video calls, the siblings finally met in person earlier this month. Denyes said the calls more than prepared them for their first meeting.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Wilson siblings"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Wilson siblings</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Boyd, centre, is seen with his four half-siblings during his trip to Digby, N.S.  (Submitted by Rick Boyd)</p></div></div></p><p>&quot;I don&#x27;t think there was any hesitation at all about getting that hug, right off the bat,&quot; she said.</p><p>Boyd went on to learn that his biological father was in fact, Gerald Wilson. He had died of a heart attack in 1973, just like he had been told.</p><p>&quot;Everything that I know about my dad, I honestly believe that he very likely did not know at all that he had another son,&quot; Denyes said. </p><p>&quot;Because I really feel certain that if he had, Rick would have been part of our life years ago.&quot;</p><p>Boyd made sure to visit his biological father&#x27;s gravesite when he was in Nova Scotia. He also visited the house where his siblings grew up. </p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Rick Boyd"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Rick Boyd</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Boyd was sure to visit his biological father&#x27;s gravesite when he was in Digby earlier this month.  (Submitted by Rick Boyd)</p></div></div></p><p>&quot;When I saw my father&#x27;s house, I was probably within a couple of hundred metres of where we used to drive by to go catch the [Digby] ferry,&quot; he said. &quot;That was my biggest regret — I had an opportunity where I could have seen him, but I never did.&quot;</p><p>Boyd said meeting his half-siblings was worth the wait. Since Boyd lives out west, they made sure to make plans for future visits and include him in the annual family photo.</p><p>&quot;That was when I knew that this was going to be a good experience,&quot; Boyd said. </p><p>&quot;I look at that photo all the time. I don&#x27;t know half the people in it, but I remember seeing the picture that Gordon sent me of his family sitting on the same steps about 18 months [earlier]. Now, here&#x27;s the same photo with more people, more first cousins, more aunts and myself in it and that&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll cherish forever.&quot;</p><p><strong>MORE TOP STORIES </strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6189860">&#x27;Relax, we are double vaxxed&#x27;: Hundreds of Dalhousie students attend street party</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6189802">Halifax rally pushes for guaranteed basic income</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6189752">Woman, 19, dead after single-car crash in Yarmouth County</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6189811">In-person meeting of Atlantic premiers shelved amid rising COVID numbers</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6189722">P.E.I.
