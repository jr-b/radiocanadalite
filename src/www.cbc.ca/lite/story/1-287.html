And what you do today, you don&#x27;t necessarily see the benefit until down years down the road, but it&#x27;s important that you set the foundation,&quot; Thompson said.</p><h2>Carrot versus stick</h2><p>Thompson said that for now, his department is using incentives rather than enforcement to encourage more focus on soil health. </p><p>&quot;To improve soil health, we want to lead with a carrot instead of a stick, and the farmers appreciate that,&quot; Thompson said.</p><p>&quot;Sometimes it&#x27;s not the most economical way to do things. But down the road, the benefits are so huge that it&#x27;s important that we lead by this example.&quot; </p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m hoping never to have to go the enforcement route.

So probably one of the reasons is because of our livestock on this Island was depleted after BSE in the early 2000s, and we haven&#x27;t built the herd up,&quot; Thompson said. </p><p>&quot;So we&#x27;re really missing that manure, and the cattle part of our ecosystem, for building the soil up.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Dexter Cattle "><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Dexter Cattle </p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: The Dexter Cattle Company&#x27;s herd provides valuable manure, something that many P.E.I. farms have been missing for the last couple of decades.
