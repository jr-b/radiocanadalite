Embry and fellow criminal lawyer Kim Schofield both noted that the Criminal Code already requires police to get special permission to execute a search warrant at night.</p><p>Tom Stamatakis, a veteran police constable in Vancouver and president of the Canadian Police Association, told CBC earlier this year that &quot;if there&#x27;s a desire to create more strident conditions around the use of this tactic, or any other policing tactic, then that is entirely appropriate and the responsibility of our provincial and federal governments, and there&#x27;s no issue with that.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Tom Stamatakis, president of the Canadian Police Association"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Tom Stamatakis, president of the Canadian Police Association</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Tom Stamatakis, president of the Canadian Police Association, says it&#x27;s up to the provinces or the or federal government to enact rules around no-knock raids.   (CBC)</p></div></div></p><h2>Have a special advocate available to counter the police</h2><p>When investigators apply to a justice of the peace or a judge for a search warrant, they&#x27;re the only ones in the room. Police officers are supposed to be full, fair and frank with the evidence, but there&#x27;s no guarantee.<strong> </strong></p><p>&quot;This is one of the only processes in the criminal justice system that takes place in the absence of the other side,&quot; Ottawa criminal lawyer Lawrence Greenspon said.</p><p>&quot;There&#x27;s nobody to argue ... as to why they shouldn&#x27;t get the warrant.&quot;</p><p>Greenspon suggested courts could have lawyers similar to the <a href="https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/fund-fina/jsp-sjp/sa-es.html">special advocates<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> in immigration law, where independent, security-cleared lawyers confidentially represent non-citizens facing deportation in national-security cases.</p><ul>   <li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.3520308">Man shot during Montreal North drug bust has died</a></li>   <li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5757442">Young man dies after falling 12 storeys during Ottawa police raid</a></li>  </ul><h2>Require police to videotape no-knock raids</h2><p>If officers violate someone&#x27;s constitutional rights in the way they execute a search warrant — for example, an unreasonably aggressive no-knock raid — any evidence found, and any resulting criminal charges, can often be tossed out. But it can be hard to prove.</p><p>&quot;Where there&#x27;s no video recording or audio recording, it&#x27;s really just the evidence of officers and then the evidence of homeowners or accused people,&quot; Inness said. &quot;Judges are really stuck then.&quot;</p><p>A number of Canadian police forces already outfit some of their officers with body-worn cameras.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Winnipeg criminal lawyer Sarah Inness"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Winnipeg criminal lawyer Sarah Inness</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Winnipeg criminal lawyer Sarah Inness says it&#x27;s important that police raids are videotaped so that there&#x27;s evidence of what really happened.  (CBC)</p></div></div></p><h2>Make it easier to get compensation</h2><p>When<strong> </strong>a door-bashing raid causes substantial damage, but police find nothing and lay no charges, it&#x27;s &quot;an uphill battle&quot; for occupants to get any compensation, said Greenspon.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s very clear what the police would do in terms of a defence: They would say, &#x27;Look, this is judicially authorized, so you can&#x27;t challenge it.&#x27; &quot;</p><p>The only remedy victims have is to sue, but that can take years. Greenspon fought for five years for the Ottawa couple whose house was raided in 2016 before they settled out of court with the city.</p><p>Stamatakis, of the Canadian Police Association, emphasized that officers are highly trained and weigh public safety considerations, but acknowledges that mistakes happen. &quot;There are always going to be incidents where there are outcomes that no one&#x27;s happy with, but we also have to remember that in most cases these warrants are executed without incident.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Embed  | No-knock raids by major Canadian police forces"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Embed  | No-knock raids by major Canadian police forces</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY"> </p></div></div></p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
