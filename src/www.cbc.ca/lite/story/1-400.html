(CBC)</p></div></div></p><p>Kootoo Toonoo stayed with her mom for a month before she died, and the language barrier is the first thing she noticed.</p><p>&quot;The elders speak their language and they&#x27;re not being understood at all, it was extremely disheartening to witness,&quot; said Kootoo. &quot;It was heartbreaking.&quot;</p><p>Kootoo found papers that elders used to translate specified requests, like asking for water or needing to use the washroom. But soon after living with her mother, she found medication that her mother was supposed to take, but had tried to dispose of.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Manitok Thompson"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Manitok Thompson</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Former Nunavut politician Manitok Thompson, who lives in Ottawa, has been an advocate for unilingual Inuit elders.  (CBC)</p></div></div></p><p>&quot;My mother told me because she didn&#x27;t know what kind of medication it was, and the nurses couldn&#x27;t answer her because they didn&#x27;t understand what she was asking, she started spitting [the medication] out into a tissue and hiding them on the side of her bed,&quot; Kootoo said. </p><p>Kootoo said she also noticed how other elders got to play activities, while Inuit were left on their own with no one to coordinate Inuktitut programming.</p><p>&quot;It made me wonder why there was nothing and I realized that they don&#x27;t have Inuit workers to give them programs,&quot; Kootoo said. </p><p>The government of Nunavut says Tungasuvvingat Inuit, a non-profit group that offers community supports to Inuit in Ottawa, has made programs available to elders at Embassy West. But those programs were suspended March 11 due to Ontario Ministry of Health and the Retirement Homes Regulatory Authority permits.</p><p>Amanda Kilabuk, Tungasuvvingat Inuit&#x27;s executive director, confirmed that COVID-19 put a halt to monthly visits and activities that her group had organized for elders at Embassy West. </p><p>But she said that her organization did not have any formal contracts with the Government of Nunavut or with Embassy West. Rather, they stepped in to fill a need, using funding they had already obtained from the federal government. </p><p>&quot;We went in and used our our own program dollars funded through the government of Canada to provide programming and bringing country food and programming for the elders,&quot; Kilabuk said. </p><h2>Comparable to residential schools: advocate</h2><p>Former Nunavut politician Manitok Thompson, who lives in Ottawa, has been an advocate for unilingual Inuit elders, ever since she was caught by surprise in 2017 when she saw an Inuk elder at Embassy West. She&#x27;s been visiting elders when she can ever since. </p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Peter Ittinuar"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Peter Ittinuar</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Former MP and Nunavut politician Peter Ittinuar says his mother has been at Embassy West since 2016.
