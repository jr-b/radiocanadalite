Glassy-eyed dead things scare the bejesus out of me. But society dictates that I should do it because I&#x27;m &quot;the man.&quot; I&#x27;m all for dismantling the patriarchy.</p><p>Eight years ago, I managed to redeem myself in my wife&#x27;s eyes.</p><p>It was 3 a.m. I was jolted awake by the sound of Jenny screaming from my infant son&#x27;s nursery. I bolted out of bed in my underwear. I thought something was wrong with my son. I thought I was about to perform CPR on a baby.</p><p>I kicked the door open and saw Jenny holding the baby.</p><p>&quot;Eek! A mouse!&quot; she shouted.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6002800">Why generation Xers threw aside our apathy and embraced vaccines</a></li></ul></p><p>I almost turned and left her there for scaring me so badly. Instead I grabbed a plastic bag and tongs. I&#x27;m not sure why I wanted tongs or how that was supposed to work. Give me a break, it was 3 a.m.</p><p>The mouse bolted like Stuart Little, hurtling over toys, careening around furniture, chancing a panicked look over his shoulder at the scantily-clad, lumbering giant stomping behind him.</p><p>He couldn&#x27;t find a toy car to make his getaway, so he ran out the door into the dining room, where I&#x27;d surely lose him. </p><p>I closed my eyes and took a breath. I reached out with my tongs and scooped him up like Mr. Miyagi catching a fly with chopsticks.</p><p>That night I went from coward, to somewhat-redeemed coward.</p><p>I&#x27;ve caught many more mice since then. Now, they fear me. They know when they see me — with my traps, rubber gloves and trademark tongs — that it&#x27;s already too late.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Silliphant mouse hunter"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Silliphant mouse hunter</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: With gloves on and tongs at the ready, Craig Silliphant has become the marmalizer of mice.

Maybe he wanted a shot at the title, to write himself into legend as the giant-slayer. But there will be no songs about him sung in mouse taverns.</p><p>So go ahead, mice. Come at me.
