It also seeks damages for any money lost because of the deal.</p><p>Newfoundland Supreme Court Justice Alexander MacDonald said he would hand down a decision on the Innu application during the week of Sept. 20.</p><p>But on Friday Sept. 24, the provincial, federal and Innu Nation governments issued a joint statement saying all three parties have &quot;requested the Court defer releasing a decision on the injunction application to provide an opportunity for discussions to take place.&quot;</p><p>The statement also said that the parties &quot;will not be commenting further at this time.&quot;</p><h2>No deal?</h2><p>It&#x27;s expected the Muskrat Falls project will be commissioned in late November. Without a deal, the cost of power for electricity ratepayers is expected to increase from 13 cents per kilowatt-hour to just under 23 cents.</p><p>Under the agreement-in-principle, rates would rise to 14.7 cents, about a 10 per cent increase.</p><p>Government officials anticipate further rate increases of about 2.25 per cent annually.</p><p><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/nl"><em><strong>Read more articles from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador</strong></em><img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a></p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
