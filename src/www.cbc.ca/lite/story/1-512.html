She along with several other activists, including Rocky Jones, Joan Jones and Lynn Jones, had planned the occupation after watching the &quot;beginning of gentrification&quot; on Gottingen Street.</p><p>&quot;The incredible thing is, as soon as the call was made that that was the strategy, there was no further debate,&quot; Wright told <em>Mainstreet</em>. </p><p>&quot;Nobody said, &#x27;Well, I don&#x27;t think we should do it.&#x27; It was just like, &#x27;OK, this is what we&#x27;re doing. This is how we&#x27;re doing it.&#x27;&quot;</p><p>Their goal was to remain in place until Human Resources Development Canada, which operated the office, became receptive to the &quot;<a href="https://library2.smu.ca/bitstream/handle/01/26894/2016.002.1_S2_SS2_F6_ItemA.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y"><u>needs and aspirations of the community with regard to employment.</u><img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a>&quot;</p><p>They also wanted the office to remain open until a new location was established that was accessible to the community.</p><p>With negotiations ongoing, the sit-in continued for weeks, then months. </p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | people outside Canada Employment Office"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | people outside Canada Employment Office</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: People gather outside the Canada Employment Office during its occupation in 1996.

It continues to be the longest running occupation of a federal government office in Canadian history.</p><p>Now, 25 years later, Gottingen Street has grown and continues to thrive.</p><p>&quot;It was important to have that win. It was important for the community who were involved to see that we could change that decision,&quot; Wright said. </p><p>&quot;We had an influence on that decision and that&#x27;s what agency looks like.
