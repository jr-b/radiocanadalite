And so I thought, maybe, if I&#x27;m not going to do it, then who else is going to look like me in this space,&quot; said Haghighi, 31, who is of Iranian and Filipino descent.</p><p>Even though some of Haghighi&#x27;s family in the Philippines are rice farmers, she admits she couldn&#x27;t picture herself in agriculture.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Embed  | Miscellaneous"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Embed  | Miscellaneous</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY"> </p></div></div></p><p>For most people, the childhood nursery rhyme, <em>Old MacDonald Had a Farm</em>, conjures up an image of the typical farmer: a &quot;white guy,&quot; says Jacqueline L. Scott, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Toronto who studies the intersection of race and nature.</p><p>&quot;Nature is coded as a white space; the city is coded as a multicultural space,&quot; she told McCue<em>.</em></p><p>&quot;So when Black people, people of colour show up in nature — whether in the rural areas, on the farms or in the wilderness in outdoor recreation, you&#x27;re seen as out of place.

If you visited St. Jacob&#x27;s, Ont., around the same time, many of the vendors selling at markets would have also been Black farmers.</p><p>&quot;But if you don&#x27;t know the history, and you go today, it&#x27;s like, &#x27;Oh, Black people weren&#x27;t here.&#x27;&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Jacqueline L.

She focuses on ecologically minded farming methods — there is no tilling to reduce weeds and efforts are made to reduce water use. This summer, she employed two BIPOC workers.</p><p>Raining Gold began with a backyard garden at Haghighi&#x27;s Toronto home in the midst of the city&#x27;s first lockdown.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5857154">Meet some of Toronto&#x27;s food justice advocates championing Black food sovereignty</a></li></ul></p><p>&quot;I had no idea what I was doing — zero,&quot; she said.</p><p>With the help of YouTube and books, she had grown a &quot;jungle&quot; of food: tomatoes, peppers and &quot;crazy cucumber plants that would have overtaken my house&quot; by the end of her first summer.</p><p>When friends announced they were moving east from Toronto to Prince Edward County, a two-hour drive away, Haghighi and her husband, Bryce, took notice. The pair scraped together their savings for a down payment on land in the county.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Embed  | Miscellaneous"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Embed  | Miscellaneous</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY"> </p></div></div></p><p>Grown at her quarter-acre plot in Prince Edward County, Haghighi sells produce from microgreens to tomatoes in subscription boxes and at local markets.</p><p>But marketing herself as a woman of colour farmer in the rural county of about 24,000 residents has been a source of pushback from locals and hateful comments online, she said.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5732635">Documentarian with Sask. roots works to reclaim myth of John Ware, the Black Prairie cowboy</a></li></ul></p><p>&quot;One of the things that was very difficult was that people would look at us and would assume that we weren&#x27;t from here or assume that we don&#x27;t live down the street, and therefore we don&#x27;t get to receive the same treatment that the other white folks would be getting,&quot; she said.</p><p>Scott said those perceptions can cause BIPOC farmers to feel as though they &quot;have to prove their credibility, their competence as farmers, because they are not what we are expecting to see.&quot;</p><h2>Changing the food system</h2><p>When she started Lucky Bug Farm in Erin, Ont., earlier this year, Aliyah Fraser says she wanted to prove there is space in the food system for BIPOC farmers.</p><p>&quot;We are the ones who think outside of the normal box of just the way that things are done, and I think if there are more of us in the food system, we can just create greater change,&quot; said Fraser, 25.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Jacqueline L Scott 2"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Jacqueline L Scott 2</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Scott stands beside a plaque commemorating the history of Black settlement in Ontario&#x27;s Oro Township.

(Donalee McIntyre)</p></div></div></p><h2>Accessing land, resources for BIPOC farmers</h2><p>An additional barrier is the significant overhead costs associated with starting a farm — and historically low rates of rural land ownership among people of colour, Fraser says.</p><p>In fact, <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/96-325-x/2017001/article/54925-eng.htm"><u>2016 Statistics Canada data</u><img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> found that women are more likely than men to rent or lease land.</p><p>Fraser has been renting a quarter-acre of land since February but will move to a new plot where she feels more supported, not only as a Black farmer but as someone new to agriculture.</p><p>&quot;I have luckily found a space for next year where the landowners are white, but they understand that it takes time to build a business and they understand that it takes time to build soil, and they understand that farming and food growing for market is really tough,&quot; she said.</p><p>Resources are top of mind for Haghighi. In addition to starting Raining Gold, purchasing the family&#x27;s property in Prince Edward County provided an opportunity to set her children up for the future.</p><p>&quot;Creating generational wealth for our children is of utmost importance to us because we don&#x27;t come from any financial privilege at all, and we don&#x27;t want our kids to have the same issues that we did,&quot; she said.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6152854">This plant medicine teacher is reclaiming Anishinaabe names for species.
