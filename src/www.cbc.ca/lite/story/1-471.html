The farm was owned by Mavis and Charlie McLeod, both now deceased. </p><p>According to their daughter, who asked that her name be withheld for privacy reasons, her father had been looking for a pump in the tank. Instead, he found a brown shoe attached to a leg sticking out of the muck.</p><p>&quot;They found that body, so their memories of finding it were not good so they never talked about it,&quot; said their daughter, who is 65 years old and lives in Tofield. </p><p>&quot;I always thought that [the killer] would be somebody local because they would have had to know that the septic tank was there.&quot;</p><p>Her parents drove to the RCMP detachment and spoke with now-retired RCMP Sgt.

When reached by phone on June 23, Lammerts told <em>The Fifth Estate</em> that he didn&#x27;t believe the case would ever be solved. </p><p>&quot;He was dumped and they had burned him up,&quot; he said. &quot;You couldn&#x27;t tell if [the victim] was a male or a female. Who had that type of capacity to assault someone like that? It&#x27;s a little tough for me.&quot;</p><p>According to newspaper reports from the time, the 1977 autopsy revealed that the victim had died a painful death. He had been tied up, sexually mutilated by a sharp object, burned and beaten before being shot in the chest and head.</p><p>According to the RCMP website, the victim was Caucasian and was between 26 and 32 years old, approximately five feet six inches tall, had a medium build, brown hair and weighed about 154 pounds.</p><p>When he was found, he was wearing a blue Levis shirt, grey T-shirt, blue jeans and brown shoes. </p><h2>Body rolled in sheet</h2><p>The body was rolled in a yellow bed sheet and tied with nylon rope before it was dumped head first into the 1.8-metre deep septic tank on the McLeods&#x27; farm, located about 65 kilometres southeast of Edmonton. </p><p>Lammerts said he believes the killer is dead by now but said that if he is still living, he is unlikely to face justice. </p><p>&quot;How [are] you going to punish the guy now anyway?&quot; Lammerts said. &quot;You going to send an 82-year-old guy to jail now?
