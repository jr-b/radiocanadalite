Support for the Greens fell to just under 400,000 votes in 2021, down from nearly 1.2 million in 2019.</p><p>Anna Keenan, a Green Party candidate who finished third in the Malpeque riding, said the leadership issues hurt the party at the voting booth.</p><p>&quot;It was clear that no matter how well we did locally, the party&#x27;s reputation had been tarnished through the controversy that had happened in the summer.&quot;</p><h2>&#x27;Wish her the best&#x27;</h2><p>The provincial Green Party forms the Official Opposition on P.E.I., with eight MLAs. Leader Peter Bevan-Baker issued an email statement to CBC on Monday acknowledging the challenges faced by his federal counterparts.</p><p>&quot;The scrutiny a person submits themselves to when they are in a position of leadership can be quite difficult and uncomfortable,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;I respect Annamie&#x27;s decision to resign and wish her the best. I sincerely hope the Green Party of Canada is able to pull together and rebuild as it begins the process of determining a path forward.&quot;</p><p>Lanthier thinks the party can rebuild in time for the next federal election.</p><p>&quot;We&#x27;ll have a new leader and we need to reform a lot of the behaviours and actions of federal council, and I&#x27;m 100 per cent for that.&quot;</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
