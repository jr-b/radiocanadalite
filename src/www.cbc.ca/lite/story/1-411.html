That raised concerns about whether airspace above the island could remain open.</p><p>ENAIRE, which manages Spain&#x27;s airspace, said two areas above the affected region are being declared no-fly zones to allow emergency services to operate freely. Many flights into and out of La Palma were delayed early Thursday.</p><p>Volcanic ash can be dangerous for aircraft. It can also cause respiratory problems, as well as potentially being an irritant for the eyes and skin.</p><p>The Emergency Military Unit deployed on the island said the readings it has taken of the air found no threat to health.</p><p><strong><em>WATCH | Drone footage from earlier this week shows lava swallowing swimming pool:</em></strong> <div><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Media Video | Drone footage of Spanish volcano shows lava swallowing swimming pool"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Media Video | Drone footage of Spanish volcano shows lava swallowing swimming pool</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: An active volcano in Spain&#x27;s Canary Islands is creating rivers of lava that are swallowing homes and even swimming pools as it snakes its way to sea. </p></div></div></div></p><p>Authorities haven&#x27;t reported any casualties from the eruption, though damage to property, infrastructure and farmland is expected to be significant.</p><p>Scientists were monitoring the volcano activity and had warned of a possible eruption. That allowed almost 7,000 people to be evacuated in time.</p><p>Spain&#x27;s King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia, and Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, visited La Palma on Thursday and met with some of those made homeless.</p><h2>Worry over lava flowing into ocean</h2><p>Officials had initially expressed fears about what would happen when the lava reached the Atlantic Ocean. The lava, whose temperature exceeds 1,000 C, could cause explosions, trigger landslides and produce clouds of toxic gas when it hits the ocean, experts say.</p><p>The eruption and its aftermath could last for up to almost three months, according to the Volcanology Institute.</p><p>Life on the rest of La Palma, which is roughly 35 kilometres long and 20 kilometres wide at its broadest point, has been largely unaffected, with tourists still landing for previously scheduled vacations.</p><p>The Canary Islands are a popular destination for European tourists due to their mild year-round climate.</p><p>The islanders mostly live from farming and tourism.</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
