And why should they have that loss?&quot; she said.</p><p>The server who spoke to CBC compares asking her to quit her job to asking women not to walk alone at night, or not to wear revealing clothing.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m not about to stop my life because some people don&#x27;t understand how to treat women or talk to people in the restaurant industry,&quot; the server said.</p><p>&quot;If I lived my life like that, I would stay home and never do anything.
