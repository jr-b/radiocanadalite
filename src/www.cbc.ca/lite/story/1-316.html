Yakiwchuk was invited by the city to take a tour of the area this summer.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m really into hiking and outdoor adventures, so I really enjoyed going to Onaping Falls,&quot; Yakiwchuk said. &quot;That was one of the most beautiful waterfalls I&#x27;ve ever seen….also the Lake Laurentian Conservation Area. That was wonderful, too.&quot;</p><p>Yakiwchuck also explored Sudbury&#x27;s urban offerings, which left a positive impression.</p><p>&quot;I know that the Up Here festival happened just shortly after my visit. But seeing all the murals down there was great,&quot; she said. &quot;And checking out the breweries and the food scene. And then, of course, I had to go to the Big Nickel and Dynamic Earth and Science North.&quot;</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6112471">Letting the air out of Airbnb?

So it was exactly what I wanted to see.&quot;</p><p>So far, the reception from readers has been positive.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s been amazing feedback, as a lot of people said that they didn&#x27;t know all those things are up in Sudbury that they could see and do,&quot; she said. &quot;And then some people said that they were thinking of going to Sudbury, and this really made them want to go even more.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people, especially in my hiking Facebook group for Ontario Hiking that have been to Sudbury and followed some of my guides. So it&#x27;s really, really amazing to see that people are taking my advice and going there and experiencing the same things and then having a wonderful time.&quot;</p><ul>   <li><a href="https://justinpluslauren.com/vegan-sudbury/">Justin Plus Lauren: Sudbury for Vegans<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a></li>  </ul></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
