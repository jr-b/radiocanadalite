out-of-territory workers who are not fully vaccinated will only have two ways to get an exemption from isolating for two weeks before traveling north: a medical exemption from a doctor, or a role in

who travel to the territory to work will no longer be exempted from isolating, the government of Nunavut said Monday.</p><p>Commonly referred to as out-of-territory workers, the government said in a news release that beginning Nov. 1, it will only grant exemptions for those who are partially vaccinated or unvaccinated to isolate in an out-of-territory isolation location under two conditions: if there is &quot;sudden and severe damage to critical infrastructure,&quot; or if a worker has a medical exemption to get a vaccine from their doctor.</p><p>&quot;Minimizing the number of unvaccinated workers traveling to the territory on exemptions will help reduce the risks of COVID-19 coming to Nunavut,&quot; said Dr. Michael Patterson, Nunavut&#x27;s chief public health officer, in a news release.</p><p>Fully vaccinated out-of-territory workers can apply for an exemption by completing a declaration form and emailing it to <a

Of those, 656 have recovered and four people have died. </p><p>The government added there is no change to the exemption process for those travelling for compassionate reasons. </p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
