On April 8, he went to Norfolk General Hospital, and within minutes, he was given oxygen.</p><h2>Team Chicken</h2><p>He spent weeks in critical condition at Hamilton General Hospital, and word of his illness spread.</p><p>Norfolk County residents started a campaign called Lights On for Chicken, keeping their porch lights on and putting out hockey sticks. A local restaurant raised money for the family. Sarah posted daily Facebook updates, which drew hundreds of comments. She just published <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Steady-We-Go-Chicken-Miracle/dp/B09GJKT3V6/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=sarah+vannetten&amp;qid=1632431383&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Steady As We Go: COVID, Chicken and a Miracle</em><img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a>. </p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5999647">45-year-old Ontario farmer is among the young and healthy being devastated by COVID-19</a></li></ul></p><p>This week, a group of Mike&#x27;s friends, dubbed Team Chicken, raised another $17,000 for a five-kilometre walk from the Simcoe Arms pub to the local golf course and back again.</p><p>The foundation hopes to raise $100,000 this year, said spokesperson Aaron Lam. In addition to an ECMO machine, it wants to buy a Spirit bed with enhanced features for patients at St. Peter&#x27;s Hospital.</p><p>ECMO machines weren&#x27;t made to treat COVID-19 patients, Lam said. But &quot;it has been found very effective for treating patients who are really strongly affected by the COVID-19 virus.&quot;</p><h2>&#x27;You&#x27;re not promised tomorrow&#x27;</h2><p>&quot;In Mike VanNetten&#x27;s case, his lungs were so damaged by the virus that basically his lungs couldn&#x27;t take in enough oxygen to pump enough blood to oxygenate his body,&quot; Lam said.</p><p>This is the second year the foundation has done a virtual run. People can donate until Sept. 26.</p><p>As for Mike, &quot;he&#x27;s doing amazingly well from where he came from,&quot; Sarah said. &quot;His biggest struggles are energy level and rebuilding strength. He&#x27;s not sleeping great. But overall, we&#x27;re just so grateful and so thankful.&quot;</p><p>The main lesson, she said, has been that &quot;you can&#x27;t take a day for granted.</p><p>&quot;Every day is a gift and you&#x27;re not promised tomorrow. So every day, do what you can.&quot;</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
