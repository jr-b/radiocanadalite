But the wheelchair-bound elder couldn&#x27;t get out of her room even for a smoke.</p><p>Out of options, her family moved her into the long-term care centre.

She lost everything, but she never lost her heart for caring, she never lost the love that she has for her children, and now we have that little glimmer of hope that something will be done with this.&quot;</p><p>Mike Westwick, a communications advisor for Municipal and Community Affairs, said the department can provide residents with information to keep them up to date on claims.</p><p>He said there are several ways to reach out for information, including by emailing flood@gov.nt.ca, reaching out to local pathfinders Kevin Menicoche or Colin McPherson, and calling the Dehcho regional office.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6032440">&#x27;We will rebuild&#x27;: Resilience and faith in Jean Marie River, a week after devastating flood</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6153202">Fort Simpson residents still waiting on repairs 3 months after flood</a></li></ul></p><p>The department is providing temporary housing for many flood victims until replacement homes arrive next year.</p><p>Westwick said where a displaced person may have complex needs, the department would work with caregivers and experts to meet their needs and get them back home.</p><p>As for long-term care costs, those could be eligible for assistance, but the individual would need to reach out to the regional office.</p><h2>More than just a house</h2><p>Nadia said every day is a struggle. The home Sanguez lost was more than just a residence – it was a sanctuary Nadia and her siblings could go to, and the place they grew up in.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Laura Sanguez&#x27;s house"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Laura Sanguez&#x27;s house</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Discoloured siding on Laura Sanguez&#x27;s house in Jean Marie River shows how high the floodwaters rose in May 2021.  (Cindy Gargan)</p></div></div></p><p>The home was originally built in 1954 or 1955 by Sanguez&#x27; late father, Charles Gargan – a little log house using wood from the nearby sawmill. It had an attic, a cellar and two bedrooms that Sanguez&#x27;s seven siblings, herself and her parents squeezed into.</p><p>It was rebuilt in the mid-1980s into a lovely new home, Nadia explained. It was the place the family would gather at for birthday celebrations, especially Sanguez&#x27;s birthdays, giving thanks for another year with her.</p><p>&quot;If I could take her home, and if I could look after her, I would be forever grateful. But I&#x27;m exactly like her right now – we&#x27;re homeless, totally homeless. And for once in my life, I feel like we have absolutely no place to go,&quot; Nadia said.</p><p>&quot;I want to bring her home to live out her life there like her brothers did.&quot;</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
