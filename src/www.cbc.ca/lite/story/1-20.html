His staff have already found instances of faked vaccination documents, including what he described as a &quot;bad Photoshop job.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s kind of surprising for me. We&#x27;re just a humble little bar,&quot; he said. &quot;If they&#x27;re doing that to come here, once everyone wants you to show proof-of-vaccination, then there&#x27;s more incentive to put in the effort to create a fake one.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Emerson 109"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Emerson 109</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Emerson 109 has been requiring proof of vaccination for customers since Aug. 20.  (emerson109bar/Instagram)</p></div></div></p><p>Emerson 109 started asking for proof that patrons had their shots back on Aug. 20, long before doing so was required. The first night they had to refuse roughly six tables, said Chan.</p><p>That trend has continued since, with two or three groups of guests being told they couldn&#x27;t eat and drink there just Monday night, according to the owner.</p><p>Turning away customers after a year of restrictions and closures isn&#x27;t easy, but Chan said he feels it&#x27;s the right thing to do.</p><p>&quot;Why am I entertaining the people that are driving the fourth wave and potentially leading to my own shutdown?&quot; he asked.</p><h2>&#x27;Better than another lockdown&#x27;</h2><p>Chan believes some people are still surprised when asked for certification of vaccination. He hopes the province mandating proof will mean people know what to expect and that will temper their reactions.</p><p>The Chamber of Commerce is hearing from businesses that are seeing the positive side of a standardized, provincial approach, too.</p><p>&quot;Most businesses would rather deal with this extra step than being forced into another lockdown,&quot; said Nash.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6182252">Hamilton library will help people print, laminate proof of vaccination for free</a></li></ul></p><p>Chan shared a similar sentiment and said that&#x27;s part of the advice he has for other business owners getting ready to enforce proof-of-vaccination for the first time.</p><p>&quot;Be firm in [your] approach,&quot; he said. &quot;Explain that you&#x27;re doing it to create a safe environment so we can end the pandemic faster.&quot;</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
