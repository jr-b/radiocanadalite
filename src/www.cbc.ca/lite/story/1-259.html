Then, Cole learned from a neighbour that they were part of a larger litter but their siblings had been killed, likely by a stray cat.</p><p>That&#x27;s when she decided to go on a mission.</p><p>&quot;I know they shouldn&#x27;t be outside, and I know they deserve a home inside where they can, you know, be happy and cared for and not have to worry about predators and getting hit by a vehicle or poor weather conditions. They kind of just took over my heart.&quot;</p><p>Cole started Two Tails Feral Rabbit Rescue, and encouraged people to let her know if they found bunnies or burrows, and she would try to find homes for them.</p><p>But the rabbits had already won over the hearts of many others in the neighbourhood, too.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Rabbits in hole"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Rabbits in hole</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Some baby bunnies, who were about eight days old and whose eyes hadn&#x27;t yet opened, were discovered just before Hurricane Ida brushed by Nova Scotia earlier this month.

People have built shelters for them and give them hay, pellets and water, and Doucette takes the rabbits to the vet if they get sick.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a few people that, you know, don&#x27;t like their hostas being eaten here and there, right, and find them a nuisance. But I would say generally, the street really loves them and they provide a lot of companionship.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Mossman"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Mossman</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: This rabbit, named Mossman, was found injured as a newborn and was kept in the house for a year.
