Can it help to treat COVID-19? And why are federal agencies like Health Canada and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warning people not to take it? </p><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about ivermectin answered.</p><h2>When is ivermectin safe for human use?</h2><p>Ivermectin is safe for human use when prescribed and dosed by a health-care professional to treat parasitic infections.</p><p>Dosage is based on the patient&#x27;s weight, medical conditions and response to the drug.</p><p>The form of the drug used on humans won the Nobel Prize, has improved the health of millions and helped to eradicate diseases like river blindness in multiple countries.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6158777">Ivermectin is a wonder drug but not for COVID — and misinformation is causing a shortage</a></li></ul></p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | India Deworming Children"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | India Deworming Children</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: A teacher administers an anti-parasite tablet to a student at a government school as part of national deworming campaign in Hyderabad, India, on Feb. 9, 2018.

You are not a cow. Seriously, y&#x27;all. Stop it,&quot; said a tweet from the U.S. FDA.</p><h2>Can ivermectin be used to treat COVID-19?</h2><p>First of all, ivermectin is used to treat parasites. COVID-19 is caused by a virus.</p><p>Some early studies appeared to show promise for its use as an anti-viral as well as an anti-parasitic — with hope that further study could prove it inhibits the growth of the novel coronavirus in human cells and improve patient outcomes.</p><p>Those results have not panned out in larger, higher quality studies, which have yet to prove whether ivermectin can slow or stop the novel coronavirus from growing in human cells.</p><p>After reports that some people were taking the veterinary form of the medicine intended for livestock, Health Canada <a href="https://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2021/76365a-eng.php">issued an advisory<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> on Tuesday asking people not to take the drug to treat COVID-19.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Embed  | Miscellaneous"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Embed  | Miscellaneous</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY"> </p></div></div></p><p>&quot;There is no evidence that ivermectin in either [the human or veterinary] formulation is safe or effective when used for those purposes,&quot; it said.</p><p>Health Canada says it&#x27;s closely monitoring all potential treatments for COVID-19, including ivermectin.</p><p>&quot;Should a manufacturer provide a submission to Health Canada related to the use of ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19, Health Canada would conduct a scientific evaluation of the evidence to determine the drug&#x27;s quality, safety and effectiveness,&quot; the agency said. </p><p>But so far, ivermectin is only approved for use to treat parasites in Canada — not COVID.</p><p>A full list of <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/authorization/list-drugs.html">drugs and vaccinations<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> authorized for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 is available on Health Canada&#x27;s website. </p><h2>But I read, or heard about, studies that suggested it was effective in treating COVID-19. What gives?</h2><p>Dr. Lynora Saxinger, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Alberta, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6158777">told CBC News</a> that early studies of ivermectin&#x27;s use either as a COVID-19 treatment or prevention consisted of low-quality data.</p><p>A review published in April in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews<em> </em>concluded that the efficacy and safety of ivermectin to treat or prevent COVID‐19 is unproven.</p><p>&quot;The completed studies are small and few are considered high quality. Several studies are underway that may produce clearer answers in review updates. Overall, the reliable evidence available does not support the use of ivermectin for treatment or prevention of COVID‐19 outside of well‐designed randomized trials,&quot; it determined. </p><p>One issue was that in some initial positive reports, patients were receiving multiple medications, so the effect of ivermectin couldn&#x27;t be parsed out. Another was that extremely high doses that showed promise in test tubes didn&#x27;t translate to human subjects.</p><p>Some studies or systematic reviews also consisted of small sample sizes.</p><p><em><strong>WATCH | Horse medication ineffective against COVID-19, says specialist:</strong></em></p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Media Video | Horse medication ineffective against COVID-19, says specialist"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Media Video | Horse medication ineffective against COVID-19, says specialist</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Epidemiologist Dr. Christopher Labos says getting vaccinated is a safer and better way to protect against the coronavirus.
