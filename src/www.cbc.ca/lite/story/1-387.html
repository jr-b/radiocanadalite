This aligns with the FDAs booster authorization and makes these groups eligible for a booster shot.&quot;</p><p>The CDC recommendation follows U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorization and clears the way for a booster rollout to begin as soon as this week for millions of people who had their second dose of the Pfizer shot at least six months ago.</p><p>President Joe Biden praised the decision at a news conference Friday morning and said he would be receiving an additional dose in the near future.</p><p>Biden assured the tens of millions of Americans who received Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson doses that they &quot;still have a high degree of protection,&quot; and that the scientific community was monitoring the data on when booster shots for those vaccines might be necessary.</p><h2>Decision affects those jabbed 6 or more months ago</h2><p>The CDC said that people 65 years and older should get a booster. Beyond older Americans, the CDC also recommended the shots for all adults over 50 with underlying conditions.</p><p>It said that, based on individual benefits and risks, 18- to 49-year-olds with underlying medical conditions may get a booster, and people 18 to 64 at increased risk of exposure and transmission due to occupational or institutional setting may get a shot.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6173861">COVID-19 vaccine boosters not widely needed, top FDA and WHO scientists say</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6171144">Advisory body recommends 3rd COVID-19 vaccine dose for some immunocompromised Canadians</a></li></ul></p><p>The recommendations only cover people who received their second Pfizer-BioNTech shot at least six months earlier. The CDC said that group is currently about 26 million people, including 13 million age 65 or older.</p><p>The CDC&#x27;s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Thursday gave the thumbs down to additional doses for groups including health-care workers, teachers and residents of homeless shelters and prisons.</p><p>Panel member Lynn Bahta, who works with the Minnesota Department of Health, voted against that measure. She said the data does not support boosters in that group yet.</p><p>&quot;The science shows that we have a really effective vaccine,&quot; she said.</p><p>The committee had said it could revisit the guidance later.</p><p></p><p>Last month, U.S. President Joe Biden and eight top health officials said they hoped to start a broad booster shot program this week, saying that emerging data showed immunity wanes over time.</p><p>Vaccine expert Dr. Paul Offit said he believed the CDC advisers were worried that recommending boosters based on employment would allow overly broad use, especially in younger people for whom the health benefits of a booster shot are still unclear.</p><p>&quot;That was a hole that you could drive a truck through, that essentially what we were doing was basically what the [Biden] administration initially asked — to just have a vaccine for the general population, because obviously the pharmacists aren&#x27;t going to figure out whether you&#x27;re working in a grocery store or hospital,&quot; he said.</p><h2>Vaccination campaign slowing</h2><p>More than 180 million people in the United States are fully vaccinated, or about 64 per cent of the eligible population. The rate has seen the U.S. passed by several countries despite getting an earlier start to its inoculation campaign.</p><p>Biden in his speech blasted elected officials &quot;actively working to undermine&quot; that campaign by spreading misinformation about the safety of vaccines.</p><p><em><strong>WATCH | WHO adviser raises concerns about COVID-19 vaccine booster shots:</strong></em> <div><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Media Video | WHO adviser raises concerns about COVID-19 booster shots"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Media Video | WHO adviser raises concerns about COVID-19 booster shots</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Dr. Peter Singer, the special adviser to the director general of the World Health Organization, called for sharing COVID-19 vaccines globally before administering booster shots for fully vaccinated people at lower risk.
