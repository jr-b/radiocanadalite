(Andrea Lavoie)</p></div></div></div><div><p>The long list of types of medical care now on hold across Saskatchewan includes home care, rehabilitation and diabetes counselling, but also key brain and heart procedures.</p><p>The Saskatchewan Health Authority provided a general list of surgeries and other care being delayed or cancelled as COVID-19 patients, most of them unvaccinated, fill the province&#x27;s hospitals and intensive care units.</p><p>This comes as COVID-19 cases have been continuing to rise, with 426 new cases in the province announced Wednesday, 54 more than were reported the day before. Hospital numbers also set a new record for the fourth day in a row Wednesday. </p><p>Specialists interviewed this week, including a neurologist and a cardiologist, provided details of changes for their patients. These include all &quot;coiling&quot; operations to prevent high-risk patients from suffering a brain aneurysm. In another example, all cardiologists were told Wednesday to cancel half of all heart stress tests, angiograms and diagnostic procedures.</p><p>&quot;We&#x27;re frustrated, tired, scared,&quot; Regina cardiologist Dr. Andrea Lavoie said.</p><p>Lavoie and Saskatoon stroke neurologist Dr. Brett Graham said anyone with an emergency will still receive the same care as always. They say anyone with urgent concerns or changes in their condition should not hesitate to call 911.</p><h2>Indefinite wait</h2><p>But the non-emergent needs of hundreds, possibly thousands, of others across the province will have to wait indefinitely. Heart disease and stroke are two of the leading causes of death in Saskatchewan. Much of the care being delayed is designed to prevent or identify major problems, but that&#x27;s not possible at the moment.</p><p>&quot;We feel for our patients. They may be feeling abandoned,&quot; Graham said.</p><p>Graham said the COVID-19 surge has also affected where patients are housed. The most critical still have beds in Saskatoon and Regina hospitals, but others are now being told to stay in Yorkton or North Battleford or other smaller centres. Still others normally admitted to hospital are under the supervision of home care staff.</p><p>The Saskatchewan Health Authority also said Wednesday that adult COVID patients are occupying beds at the Jim Pattison Children&#x27;s Hospital.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6185420">Adult COVID-19 patients being treated in Sask. children&#x27;s hospital, SHA says</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6183801">COVID-19 cases found in 30 long-term and personal care homes in the province</a></li></ul></p><p>Lavoie and Graham said health-care staff are working around the clock to provide the best care they can to all patients.</p><p>But Lavoie said there is frustration and sadness as well, because none of this had to happen.</p><p>For weeks, health professionals, academics, scientists, statistical modelling experts, municipal leaders and many others pointed to evidence of a fourth wave driven by the more virulent delta variant of the coronavirus. The Saskatchewan Medical Association, the Saskatchewan Union of Nurses and the government&#x27;s own medical health officers called for indoor mask mandates and vaccine passports.</p><p>Anti-mask and anti-vaccine residents rallied repeatedly to assert what they saw as their individual freedoms and rights. Premier Scott Moe and Health Minister Paul Merriman encouraged residents to act in a safe manner, but rejected calls for more government rules.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | dr"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | dr</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Saskatoon stroke neurologist Dr. Brett Graham says anyone suffering a health emergency will still get care, but dozens of his patients&#x27; elective procedures and surgeries will be delayed or cancelled because of COVID-19.
