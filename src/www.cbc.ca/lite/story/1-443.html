are all kinds of courses being taught about rock, pop, folk artists, Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga, it goes on and on,&quot; Higgins told CBC&#x27;s <em>Metro Morning</em> on Monday.</p><p>&quot;So why

&quot;Why is that?&quot; and also teach them how to succeed in marketing themselves. </p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Media Audio | Ryerson students can now learn about
