(Supplied by SafeSight Exploration)</p></div></div></p><h2>A new technology for mine rescue</h2><p>While operating mines have been using drones for several years to map out sites, for example, their use in mine rescue situations is much newer, said Ted Hanley, vice-president of Ontario Mine Rescue.</p><p>Hanley said a rescue scenario presents a more challenging environment in which to operate a drone, because there are many unknowns, and smoke, fire and debris can impede their sensors.</p><p>He said he is only aware of one situation so far, where a drone was used during an underground mine rescue operation. A Philadelphia-based company, Exyn Technologies, developed a drone that was used during a mine rescue in Ghana.</p><p>But Hanley said Mine Rescue Ontario is ready to deploy a drone, necessary for any future emergency in the province.</p><p>&quot;It has not been used for those purposes in Ontario, somewhat thankfully,&quot; he said. &quot;We don&#x27;t wish for those circumstances to occur, but there are a few UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) providers that we&#x27;re in contact with.&quot;</p><p>Hanley said drones are most useful as a tool to gather information. </p><p>&quot;So the UAV or any robotic technology that&#x27;s unmanned, being able to inspect an area during an emergency is potentially bringing us back that missing percentage of information that can allow us to make a safe decision on whether to send or not send rescuers into an area.&quot;</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
