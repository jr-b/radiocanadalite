At their peak, they boasted out-the-door customer lineups on many weekends.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5217307">Who&#x27;s really behind Toronto&#x27;s chain of illegal pot shops that won&#x27;t quit?</a></li></ul></p><p>Distinguishing itself with its sleek decor and lifestyle branding, CAFE&#x27;s locations functioned much like any coffee shop in front — selling beverages and pastries — but in back or upstairs, illegal cannabis bud, edibles and other products were on offer.</p><p>The chain gained a loyal following in Toronto as it bucked more than a dozen police and bylaw enforcement attempts to shut down its stores. Officers would raid them and then weld the doors shut or pile up huge cement blocks outside to block entry. But often within hours, the locations would reopen.</p><p>For years, Galvano flaunted his wealth on social media, posting pics of his latest Gucci or Christian Louboutin shoes, his Lamborghini Huracan, a $432 Wagyu steak dinner and his business-class jet-setting to Europe and South America.</p><p>He made frequent trips to Colombia, including on a private charter with Weber, friends and other CAFE staff in 2019. On an earlier trip to the country, he posted pics on Instagram of visiting former drug lord Pablo Escobar&#x27;s grave.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Jon Galvano with Lamborghini Huracan"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Jon Galvano with Lamborghini Huracan</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Galvano&#x27;s Instagram posts included a number of photos of his Lamborghini Huracan.

He pleaded guilty to drug charges in 2010 and 2011 and one count of violating probation, and was fined each time.</p><p>His former criminal lawyer, Robert DiPietro, told CBC News in a 2019 interview that Galvano was a &quot;very smart business guy&quot; who was always working hard and &quot;trying to move ahead.&quot;</p><p>CAFE did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on Friday evening.</p><hr/><p><em><strong>If you have a tip on this or any other story, email <a href="mailto:zach.dubinsky@cbc.ca?subject=Tip%20for%20you">zach.dubinsky@cbc.ca<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> or call 416-205-7553</strong></em></p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
