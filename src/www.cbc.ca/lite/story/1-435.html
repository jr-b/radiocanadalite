The commissioner can also use informal means to resolve a complaint, like a caution or information letter.</p><h2>Cabinet contender</h2><p>Lori Williams, a professor of political science at Calgary&#x27;s Mount Royal University, said the investigation is a big hit for an MP that was likely to be tapped for cabinet as one of only two Liberals elected in Alberta. </p><p>&quot;When you know there are questions around the judgment of an MP-elect before cabinet selections have been made, it&#x27;s much less likely that they&#x27;ll be chosen for cabinet unless the investigation shows there&#x27;s nothing to worry about, no charges will be laid, no offence being considered,&quot; she said. </p><p>&quot;Unless that sort of information comes up in time for the cabinet picks, this is likely to disqualify George Chahal from membership in the cabinet.&quot;</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
