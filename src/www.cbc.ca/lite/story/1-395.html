The organization had just sold out of 500 orange shirts in five days, and couldn&#x27;t keep up. MAKE had worked with them in the past, providing their clients with masks during the COVID-19 pandemic, and felt they could do more. </p><p>Since it was established in 1988, UNYA has worked to provide opportunities for Indigenous youth in Vancouver. The non-profit offers access to healthcare, exercise classes, educational courses and a food pantry, among other services.</p><p>&quot;We&#x27;ve seen what they&#x27;ve done and what they do, and we just really thought what they were doing was amazing,&quot; Pacey said. </p><p>They worked with UNYA and local Indigenous artist KC Hall, who donated the design, to create their unique orange shirt. </p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | stack-of-tees"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | stack-of-tees</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: MAKE sold more than 25,000 orange shirts featuring a design by KC Hall, with 100 per cent of the proceeds being donated to the Urban Native Youth Association.

They also received orders from the Netherlands and the U.S. </p><p>By the end of the campaign, the Vancouver shop raised $37,373. </p><p>&quot;I was blown away,&quot; UNYA CEO Cheryl Robinson said.  </p><p>&quot;I knew there was a lot of traffic and I knew that there were a lot of people looking for orange shirts, but just the magnitude.
