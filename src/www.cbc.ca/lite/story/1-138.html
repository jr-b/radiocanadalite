Reaching out to females and folks from the 2SLGBTQ+ community is important to me,&quot; he added. </p><p>The program is in its earliest stages. Kuber hosted a demo session for would-be participants outside the Bernie Custis Secondary School on Thursday.</p><p>He said student athletes can sign up via STAC&#x27;s Facebook page.

I don&#x27;t think that there&#x27;s any better way right now to uplift athletics in the Black community than with a program like this. I think it&#x27;s amazing.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Brandon Bernard"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Brandon Bernard</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Brandon Bernard is an executive member of the Black Student Athletes&#x27; Council at McMaster University and a member of the basketball team.
