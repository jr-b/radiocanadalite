But on Saturday it said it was acting because of the &quot;exceptional circumstances this year.&quot;</p><p>The government said it would issue 5,000 three-month visas for truck drivers starting in October, and another 5,500 for poultry workers. But it stuck to its insistence that in the long term British workers should be trained to take the driving jobs, and transportation companies must improve their pay and working conditions to keep them.</p><p>&quot;After a very difficult 18 months, I know how important this Christmas is for all of us, and that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re taking these steps at the earliest opportunity to ensure preparations remain on track,&quot; Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6188919">Some gasoline stations in U.K. run out of fuel as pandemic supply chain crisis deepens</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6160851">COVID-19 created lots of supply chain problems — and they&#x27;re nowhere close to being solved</a></li></ul></p><p>But he added that U.K. firms &quot;must also play their part with working conditions continuing to improve and the deserved salary increases continuing to be maintained in order for companies to retain new drivers.&quot;</p><h2>Lack of driver testing during lockdowns</h2><p>One cause of the trucker shortage is a backlog caused by the suspension of driver testing for months during Britain&#x27;s coronavirus lockdowns. The government has already increased testing capacity, as well as extending the number of hours that drivers can work each week, prompting safety concerns.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Truck driver instructor Graham Bolger directing trainee Cadhene Lubin-Hewitt in Croydon"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Truck driver instructor Graham Bolger directing trainee Cadhene Lubin-Hewitt in Croydon</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Instructor Graham Bolger directs learner truck driver Cadhene Lubin-Hewitt as he drives at the National Driving Centre in Croydon, south London, on Wednesday.
