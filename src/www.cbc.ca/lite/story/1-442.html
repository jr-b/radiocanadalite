She hopes that the book serves as an inspiration for Indigenous athletes.</p><p>&quot;For that young person that might be saying, what is the significance of my journey? How can I be someone who is a person of value, whether that&#x27;s in sport or not? A book like this really helps them piece together that narrative for themselves,&quot; said Lamoureux.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6135132">New digital book aims to educate Canadians about Indigenous sport heroes</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6061509">Indigenous athletes contend with numerous barriers en route to Olympic qualification</a></li></ul></p><p>Forsyth, who is from Fisher River Cree Nation about 200 kilometres north of Winnipeg, is an associate professor in sociology, and the director of the Indigenous Studies program at Western University. </p><p>She said the book is a direct response to the TRC&#x27;s Call to Action 87 &quot;to provide public education that tells the national story of Aboriginal athletes in history.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We want to be involved in sport, but we want to do it in our own way and it may not be the way that is already established and people need to understand that,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;And so that is reconciliation, trying to understand sport from Indigenous points of view.&quot; </p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
