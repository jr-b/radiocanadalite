That letter was dated Sept. 3, more than two weeks before election day.</p><p>&quot;As you are aware, barriers to registration and voting in elections are higher in fly-in First Nations than elsewhere and it is disappointing to learn that the citizens of Cat Lake will now experience additional barriers,&quot; the letter continued.</p><blockquote class="pullquote">  We always encourage First Nations people to be part of that democratic process, but when there&#x27;s barriers, it just undermines the democracy and the right that we have to vote.  <cite class="pullquote-source">- Sol Mamakwa, NDP MPP for Kiiwetinoong riding in northern Ontario</cite> </blockquote><p>Mamakwa said it was after he wrote this letter, calling on Elections Canada to maintain their &quot;commitment to accessible voting for all Canadians&quot; and provide &quot;alternate voting options for First Nations with similar needs for accommodation,&quot; that he heard the federal agency responsible for elections granted the request for advance polls in the three First Nations.</p><p>However, on election day, leaders and residents in the First Nations took to social media to express shock that Elections Canada holding advance polls in the communities meant they wouldn&#x27;t get a polling station on election day.</p><p>A voter card from a Pikangikum resident, shared to social media, showed they were told there would be a polling station in the First Nation on Sept. 20.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Pikangikum voter card"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Pikangikum voter card</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: A voter card from a resident of Pikangikum First Nation, shared to social media, incorrectly shows there would be a polling station on election day in the First Nation.
