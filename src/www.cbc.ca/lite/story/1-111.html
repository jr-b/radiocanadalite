Alberta currently does not have a proof-of-vaccination app, but the government has said it plans to create a QR code.</p><p>Conrad Yeung, a local web developer, said he was curious about the Portpass app after reading an article about it. But shortly after downloading the app, he noticed an issue when it asked him to upload his photo ID.</p><p>Yeung said he uploaded a random photo of a mayoral candidate in Calgary &quot;just to see if the app would let me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It let me upload a random photo for my driver&#x27;s licence,&quot; he said. &quot;And then I was like, you know what? There&#x27;s probably something sketchy here so I&#x27;m just going to upload fake stuff and see what happens.&quot;</p><p>Yeung made a fake vaccination record with an actor&#x27;s name and the app verified it as legitimate.</p><blockquote class="pullquote">  There&#x27;s a lot of questions when it comes to these types of apps … who has access to it?

However, the CDHN&#x27;s main webpage links back to the Portpass website and other links on the CDHN website led to &quot;404 page not found&quot; messages on Sunday. </p><p>CBC News called Portpass founder and CEO Zakir Hussein on Sunday afternoon.</p><p>Hussein initially agreed to talk and said he had seen Yeung&#x27;s Twitter posts expressing concerns about the app. But shortly into the recorded interview he ended the call mid-sentence, and then said in a followup call that he would speak with CBC before 6:30 p.m. MT that day to give his team time to look into the issues. Followup calls were not returned.</p><h2>Portpass recommended by Calgary Flames</h2><p>Portpass is recommended by the Calgary Sports and Entertainment Corporation as the preferred way to provide proof of vaccination for attendees at Calgary Flames hockey games at the Scotiabank Saddledome or Calgary Stampeders football games at McMahon Stadium.</p><p>CBC reached out to CSEC for comment but has yet to receive a response.</p><p>Those planning to attend Sunday&#x27;s Flames game were told in advance that, &quot;for the most efficient entry possible, all ticket holders should sign up and download <a href="https://portpass.ca/"><u><strong>Portpass</strong></u><img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> and complete their COVID-19 proof of vaccination online or through the app.&quot;</p><p>But after Yeung publicly raised concerns and CBC called Portpass&#x27;s CEO, multiple people reported that the app no longer appeared to be fully functioning — simply showing a grey screen and the words &quot;undefined undefined&quot; instead of a name on the vaccine verification screen. </p><p>At 5:17 p.m. MT, less than two hours before the hockey game&#x27;s scheduled start, the company tweeted it was having &quot;<a href="https://twitter.com/portpasscanada/status/1442266448458498050">technical difficulties<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a>&quot; and asked users to bring a printed vaccine record to the game instead.</p><p>Flames fan Mckenna Baird said he downloaded the app on the NHL team&#x27;s recommendation, and when it wouldn&#x27;t load he initially assumed it was an issue specific to his phone.</p><p>&quot;Because the Portpass app is not working we&#x27;re not able to get into the arena,&quot; Baird said as he waited outside the Saddledome on Sunday. &quot;It&#x27;s definitely upsetting.… Hopefully they&#x27;ll get it sorted out.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Calgary Flames proof of vaccine"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Calgary Flames proof of vaccine</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Calgary Flames fans head into Sunday&#x27;s pre-season game at the Scotiabank Saddledome.

He said police told him that badge number doesn&#x27;t exist.

Can it be manipulated? Is it secure?&quot; Kotak said. &quot;You&#x27;re literally giving away so much personal information about yourself that can be used against you.… That&#x27;s my word of caution when we just decide to arbitrarily give up our data to private corporations.
