They kept him under surveillance and began developing a plan that could capitalize on his lifestyle.</p><p>Undercover cops made contact with Greg in August 2018 and began weaving their web.

It was all complicated by the supposed target being only known by a nickname.</p><p>It was resolved by the undercover team getting Greg out province &quot;until he no longer wanted the target killed,&quot; she testified.</p><h2>The head injury</h2><p>And then on Jan. 1, 2019 — six months into the sting — Greg slipped and cracked his head. He was taken by ambulance to hospital and then checked himself out the same day.</p><p>Six days later, the undercover cops were contacted by Greg&#x27;s girlfriend and told that he was on the floor of their house in medical distress and needed help.</p><p>They arrive to find him collapsed, with swelling to his head. He&#x27;d also soiled himself, but was adamantly refusing to go back to hospital. EMTs were called and he was finally convinced to go to hospital.</p><p>Climenhaga said it wasn&#x27;t until June 2019 that Greg made his disclosure to the fake crime boss that he killed Sheree.</p><p>Climenhaga is back on the stand Tuesday as the examination in chief continues.</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
