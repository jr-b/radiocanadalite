Her mom, Bette Morriseau, and her dad, Ken Young, met at Dauphin Residential School in Manitoba.</p><p>She remembers her father telling her about how he ran away from school when he was first sent there at five years old. He spoke no English and fled into the nearby potato fields. He says he got lost and might have frozen to death if the nuns didn&#x27;t discover him.</p><p>Young asked beaders to create a single vamp instead of a matching pair to reflect the unfinished journeys of those children who never returned home. She plans to donate the collection to Carleton University&#x27;s school of social work where she is a PhD student.</p><p><div><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Deborah Young&#x27;s parents"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Deborah Young&#x27;s parents</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Youn&#x27;s mother Bette Morriseau, left, is from Peguis First Nation in Manitoba.

(Ken Young)</p></div></div></div></p><h2>From father to daughter</h2><p>Young says her parents tried to create a home life for her they never experienced, but they struggled with the impact of the schools when they became parents.</p><p>&quot;My dad had a hard time showing love. I don&#x27;t recall him ever, ever telling me that he loved me or hugging me,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;That was just how dad was.&quot;</p><p>Young remembers feeling ashamed of her identity, using drugs, and running away to the streets of Winnipeg.</p><p>&quot;I did a lot of damage to myself ... and I think it&#x27;s because I hated myself. I believe that is connected to the violence that my people have suffered over generations.&quot;</p><p>It&#x27;s something she&#x27;s tried to change when it comes to her own two children, who are now adults.</p><p>&quot;Things like that really impact people — when children don&#x27;t receive the love that they deserve.&quot;</p><p><div><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Beaded vamps"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Beaded vamps</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Young says she has received nearly 200 beaded vamps from as far away as California and the U.K.  (Fangliang Xu)</p></div></div></div><div><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Deborah 215 beads"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Deborah 215 beads</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: This beaded vamp came with a letter explaining 215 beads were used in its creation.

(Fangliang Xu)</p></div></div></div></p><h2>A reckoning during a pandemic</h2><p>As part of the project Young has taught new beaders online, while participants have also organized outdoor beading circles. For her, beading is about community, resistance and healing.</p><ul>   <li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6055412"><u><strong>Yukon beading project that honours 215 children gets &#x27;amazing&#x27; response</strong></u></a></li>  </ul><p>&quot;I think it&#x27;s helped people get through not just the pandemic, but also the trauma that we&#x27;re experiencing as a country, as we think about what has happened around residential schools, around colonial violence — that&#x27;s a lot of stuff people are working through.&quot;</p><p>She was heartened by the outpouring of grief after the revelations in Kamloops, B.C., this spring, but she worries the conversation has now quieted.</p><p>&quot;You just can&#x27;t have a reckoning and then have it die as quickly as it came. It can&#x27;t work that way. It can&#x27;t happen again.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Deborah beading cirle"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Deborah beading cirle</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Young says getting together, even at a distance, to make art together can be powerful.

She hopes despite the small size of the creations she&#x27;s gathering, her efforts will have real impact on generations to come.</p><p>&quot;What is a vamp?
