If you don&#x27;t use fire to protect the land, the fuel stacks up and then you end up with huge fires that do more damage than good,&quot; Chief Darrel Draney told <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent"><em><u>The Current&#x27;s</u></em><img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> Matt Galloway.</p><p>Prescribed burns are conducted during the spring and fall, creating breaks to slow or stop wildfires. They used to be common practice, and after being outlawed for a while, are now allowed again — but only on a small scale. </p><p>When the enormous <a href="https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/knowing-fire/"><u>Sparks Lake Fire threatened Skeetchestn First Nation in July</u><img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a>, members were able to funnel the flames into historic prescribed burn areas, preventing damage to homes and buildings. </p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Darrel"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Darrel</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Darrel Draney is the chief of the Skeetchestn Indian Band.  (Matt Meuse/CBC)</p></div></div></p><p>Despite that success, much of the land surrounding their community was scorched. Draney said more prescribed burns could have prevented that damage done to the land.</p><p>While most of the community was evacuated, 75 firekeepers and volunteers stayed behind to fight the fire.</p><p>Darrell Peters led the Skeetchestn crew, and had help from about 100 people from B.C. Wildfire Service. </p><p>&quot;With the Sparks fire here, [B.C. Wildfire Service] started to communicate with me a little bit better; they took my knowledge into consideration,&quot; said Peters, head of Skeetchestn&#x27;s territorial patrol.</p><p>&quot;And then we started capitalizing on making the right calls, getting a handle on things.&quot;</p><p>But he still wishes authorities would &quot;open up to be more co-operative,&quot; and engage more with the knowledge of &quot;the ranchers, the people from the reserves and the loggers that know the land.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Hillside"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Hillside</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: The hillsides of the Criss Creek valley sit covered in burnt trees.

(Matt Meuse/CBC)</p></div></div></p><p>&quot;I think they should have open arms to our knowledge of the area, of how to deal with the fires,&quot; he said.</p><p>B.C. Wildfire Services said it agrees that the First Nation&#x27;s insight was beneficial for managing the Sparks Lake fire. In a statement emailed to CBC, B.C. Wildfire Services said it&#x27;s &quot;working to provide more resources and support to communities that are looking to use prescribed fire or cultural burns more frequently.&quot;</p><p>Wildfire Services says there is no specific limit on how much prescribed burns can happen in a year, and it only allows what is safe in the off-season. </p><p>&quot;Specific weather patterns need to be present to ensure safe and efficient prescribed burning. Planning a prescribed burn can often take months to over a year before the burn is implemented.&quot; </p><p>Other provinces operate similarly across the country, planned for the spring or fall, when conditions are safe. </p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | firebreak"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | firebreak</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Band members and fire crews used heavy equipment to dig large firebreaks all around Skeetchestn territory in an effort to protect the community.  (Matt Meuse/CBC)</p></div></div></p><h2>Traditional knowledge</h2><p>Peters grew up on the land, and comes from a long line of firekeepers. His grandmother fought fires, as did his great grandmother. He gained knowledge of the territory and environment from his time hunting and gathering. </p><p>Peters uses that knowledge to fight fires, but also set controlled fires in the off season. He also does cultural burns, a sacred Indigenous practice that uses low-intensity fire as a form of ecological stewardship.</p><p>&quot;You have to understand in those ceremonies we asked fire to go away, but we also asked to come back. We need fire. We want it back,&quot; said Chief Draney.</p><p>With <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6093537"><u>the prospect of destructive fire seasons becoming an annual challenge</u></a>, Draney wants financing for emergency response teams made up of locals, properly equipped and ready to move as soon as a fire starts.</p><p>Those teams would have &quot;the knowledge of the specific spot, how much fuel it has, when to attack it and when not to attack it,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;If we are resourced properly, we could have this taken care of way faster than B.C. mobilizes a team to get here.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Darrell Peters"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Darrell Peters</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Darrell Peters is head of the Skeetchestn Territorial Patrol, who uses his knowledge of fire and the landscape to protect his community, like his grandmother and great-grandmother before him.

He&#x27;s deeply grateful for the crews that stayed and saved the houses in the valley, including his own, but he says the devastation to the surrounding forests is a huge blow to a community that relies primarily on hunting and gathering.</p><p>&quot;We teach our children to respect what&#x27;s out there on the land,&quot; he said. &quot;And when you go out on the land and you see nothing but black and ashes — what is there to teach?&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Terry Deneault"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Terry Deneault</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Terry Deneault, a Skeetchestn Elder and Knowledge Keeper, stands in front of his beloved Deadman Creek.

It specifically looks like reforming industrial forestry from the bottom up. Everything has to change about it,&quot; said Hammond.</p><p>&quot;It looks like putting land management back in the hands of First Nations, and it looks like that within 10 years, not a long-term plan,&quot; she said. </p><p>&quot;We don&#x27;t have time for that anymore. All of those things need to happen at once in order for us to actually have a fighting chance here.&quot;</p><hr/><p><em>Written by Philip Drost.
