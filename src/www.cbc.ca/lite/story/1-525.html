In each age group, they look for potential side effects, and then measure the immunity levels generated by the vaccine.</p><p>&quot;12 to 15 year olds had almost twice as good of an immune response as the next age group, 16 to 25, and even a much higher antibody response than adults 18 to 50 or over 65,&quot; Dr. Talaat told <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks"><em>Quirks &amp; Quarks</em><img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> host Bob McDonald. &quot;Kids five to 11 had the same immune response as the adolescents, so you expect it to be incredibly effective in that population.&quot;</p><p>Dr. Talaat is an infectious-disease physician and vaccine scientist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. She said that even though kids tend not to get sick from COVID as frequently or seriously compared to adults, getting this age group vaccinated is crucial in slowing down the pandemic&#x27;s spread.</p><p>&quot;There is absolutely a benefit to protecting the kids. There&#x27;s also a benefit to society as a whole, because the more people you vaccinate, the less susceptible people the virus will find to replicate in and transmit to other people, and the better control you can get over the pandemic.&quot;</p><p>You can listen to Bob McDonald&#x27;s full conversation with Dr. Talaat at the link above.</p><hr/><p><em>Produced and written by Amanda Buckiewicz</em><br/>  </p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
