The Ontario farm now faces 20 charges.  (Submitted by Chaparro Family)</p></div></div></div><div><p>An Ontario farm where an outbreak of COVID-19 affected more than 200 workers, including a man from Mexico who later died, now faces 20 charges following an inspection by the provincial Labour Ministry.</p><p>Charges filed with the Ontario Court of Justice under the Occupational Health and Safety Act say Scotlynn Sweetpac Growers Inc. and its owner, Scott Biddle, failed to take &quot;every precaution reasonable&quot; to protect workers from COVID-19 infection on the vegetable farm in Vittoria, located about 75 kilometres south of Hamilton. </p><p>Scores of workers tested positive for COVID-19 in an outbreak in the spring of 2020. Juan Lopez Chaparro, a 55-year-old from Mexico, died in June that year after working at the farm. </p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5630644">Migrant worker remembered as &#x27;hard-working man of peace&#x27;</a></li></ul></p><p>The charges, which have not been proven in court, say the farm and its owner failed to protect workers in the following ways:</p><ul>   <li>Workers weren&#x27;t informed about the need to wear face coverings.</li>   <li>Workers didn&#x27;t have access to hand hygiene facilities. </li>   <li>There was a lack of cleaning on touch surfaces. </li>   <li>Workers with a higher likelihood of transmitting COVID-19 and those showing symptoms weren&#x27;t given information or instructions to self-isolate.  </li>  </ul><p>CBC News called Scotlynn group for comment on Monday after 5 p.m. ET and was told by an employee who answered the phone to call back on Tuesday.</p><p>Chaparro — like thousands of workers who come to Ontario each growing season — was in Canada as part of the federal Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program, which allows farmers to hire temporary foreign workers.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5621866">Migrant worker who died on Ontario farm identified as Mexican father of four</a></li></ul></p><p>One worker at Scotlynn Sweetpac, Luis Gabriel Flores, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5799474">was fired after speaking out about conditions at the farm</a>. He was Chaparro&#x27;s bunkmate.</p><p>The province&#x27;s Labour Relations Board ordered Scotlynn Growers to pay Flores $20,000 in lost wages and $5,000 in damages.</p><p>Migrant workers typically live in communal bunkhouses with shared kitchens and bathrooms, conditions health officials and advocates for migrant workers had warned, prior to the outbreak, created unsafe conditions in a pandemic. Advocates say the workers&#x27; families rely on money they earn in Canada, and many don&#x27;t speak out for fear of losing their jobs and the ability to earn during the growing season.</p><p>Karen Cocq, who&#x27;s with the group Migrant Workers Alliance for Change, said the charges should have come much sooner than a year after Chaparro&#x27;s death.</p><p>&quot;[The delay] means the systems that we currently have in place, that are supposed to enforce laws and protect workers, clearly are not working,&quot; she said. </p><p>Cocq said the case involving Chaparro marks the first time any Ontario employer has been charged in response to a worker&#x27;s death due to a COVID-19 outbreak. </p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5799474">Migrant worker who took on boss and won is a &#x27;very brave, exceptional man,&#x27; says lawyer</a></li></ul></p><p>The penalties section of the Occupational Health and Safety Act list possible penalties ranging from jail sentences of up to a year and fines that range up to $1.5 million.</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
