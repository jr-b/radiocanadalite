Tony Mancini put forth the motion for the staff report. He said he came up with the idea after hearing about two people who couldn&#x27;t attend job interviews because they had nowhere to shower.</p><p>&quot;This is immediate, something that&#x27;s needed right away,&quot; said Mancini.</p><p>&quot;Do we need more housing? Absolutely. We need more affordable housing? Absolutely.&quot;</p><p>Mancini noted that housing matters are primarily the responsibility of the province. He said for too long the three levels of government have not done enough on housing.</p><p>Within the past month, Halifax <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6160202">council approved two motions </a>related to housing. One is to allocate $500,000 to the creation of emergency housing, like hotel rooms and other spaces, and the other is to devote federal rapid housing initiative funds to create 85 new affordable units.</p><h2>Rent cap</h2><p>The province introduced a <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5815827">temporary rent cap</a> last year that limits rent increases to two per cent.</p><p>Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston, who was sworn in last month, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6150707">has repeatedly said rent control is not something he plans to continue</a>.</p><p>Housing Minister John Lohr <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6162788">suggested earlier this month the government would consider extending rent control beyond the state of emergency</a>.</p><p><strong>MORE TOP STORIES </strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6189146">Last-minute nuptials lead to wedding boom in Nova Scotia</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6189860">&#x27;Relax, we are double vaxxed&#x27;: Hundreds of Dalhousie students attend street party</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6188474">Alberta man unites with long lost half-siblings in Nova Scotia after surprise DNA test</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6189722">P.E.I.
