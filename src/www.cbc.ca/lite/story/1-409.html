Countries from around the world send their best science-fair projects to the competition, which was held earlier this month in Salamanca, Spain. </p><p>&quot;There are so many great projects, and to be recognized among them, I feel honoured and proud,&quot; said Singh, who is a Grade 10 student at Cameron Heights Collegiate and attended the competition remotely.</p><p>Speculor uses a portable imager to take photos of the eye and artificial intelligence (AI) to screen for disease. It costs about $300 — far less than the closest comparable medical device, a fundus camera, which can cost up to $5,000. </p><h2>Inspired by a friend</h2><p>Singh said he became interested in ophthalmology after a friend&#x27;s detached retina went misdiagnosed for a long time. </p><p>&quot;That really got me interested — like, if this can happen in a richer and more developed area like Waterloo, what could the conditions be like in other areas which don&#x27;t have as much access?&quot; said Singh. </p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | prototypes "><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | prototypes </p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: The first two prototypes of Singh&#x27;s eye-care platform Speculor, which recently won second prize at the European Union Contest for Young Scientists.   (Submitted by Hardit Singh)</p></div></div></p><p>Singh said the technology could be particularly useful for field workers with international non-governmental organizations, who could bring it to remote villages and quickly test many different patients at once. </p><p>&quot;Then the AI would be able to classify and see which patients need extra help,&quot; said Singh.</p><p>&quot;That would be the idea — of bringing the care to the patient — instead of the patient having to go to some tertiary expensive hospital to get the same care.&quot; </p><p>Singh said the tool could also be useful in rural and remote parts of Canada, where eye care is inaccessible. </p><h2>Screening for glaucoma</h2><p>At this point, Singh said the technology is mainly intended to diagnose glaucoma — the second-leading cause of blindness worldwide, according to the World Health Organization — but down the road he believes it could also be used for conditions like retinal detachment and macular degeneration. </p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.4316371">London science fair whiz kid wins big at international competition</a></li></ul></p><p>The word Speculor is drawn from a Latin term that means &quot;to watch&quot; or &quot;to explore,&quot; which Singh said also summed up the main thrust of his project.  </p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m trying to help people have the ability to see,&quot; he said. </p><p>&quot;And when I was developing my project, I did a lot of exploration, so I thought that word really summed up ... the entire process of science as well.&quot;</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.4311694">Calgary student&#x27;s childhood cancer project impresses at international science fair</a></li></ul></p><p>Singh said he hopes to soon create his own company and get Speculor out in the real world. He&#x27;s using the €5,000  (C$7,500) in prize money from the competition for that purpose — and is saving some for university. </p><p>He also hopes to continue competing, with the Canadian Physics Olympiad next on his to-do list. </p><p>&quot;I&#x27;ve become a lot more interested in physics … so I think that&#x27;s what my next goal is for the future,&quot; he said. </p><p><em>Listen to the full interview:</em></p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Media Audio | Waterloo teen Hardit Singh on his second place finish in the European Union Contest for Young Scientists"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Media Audio | Waterloo teen Hardit Singh on his second place finish in the European Union Contest for Young Scientists</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Waterloo teen Hardit Singh impressed the judges at this year&#x27;s European Union Contest for Young Scientists.
