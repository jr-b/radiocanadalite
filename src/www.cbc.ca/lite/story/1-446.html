He was 89.</p><p>In a statement, his family said that Van Peebles, father of the actor-director Mario Van Peebles, died Tuesday evening at his home in Manhattan.</p><p>&quot;Dad knew that Black images matter. If a picture is worth a thousand words, what was a movie worth?&quot; Mario Van Peebles said in a statement Wednesday. &quot;We want to be the success we see, thus we need to see ourselves being free.

It meant appreciating the power, beauty and interconnectivity of all people.&quot;</p><p>Sometimes called the &quot;godfather of modern Black cinema,&quot; the multitalented Van Peebles wrote numerous books and plays, and recorded several albums — playing multiple instruments and delivering rap-style lyrics.

The New York Times, for example, accused Van Peebles of merchandizing injustice and called the film &quot;an outrage.&quot;</p><p>Van Peebles, who complained fiercely to the Motion Picture Association over the X-rating, gave the film the tagline: &quot;Rated X by an all-white jury.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | SHOWBIZ"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | SHOWBIZ</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: NBA legend Magic Johnson, second from left, and his wife, Cookie, left, arrive with Panther director Mario Van Peebles and Melvin Van Peebles, who wrote the screenplay, at the film&#x27;s benefit premiere for Johnson&#x27;s AIDS Foundation on May 2, 1995.  (Fred Prouser/Reuters)</p></div></div></p><p>But in the wake of its success, Hollywood realized an untapped audience and began churning out such box office hits as <em>Shaft</em> and <em>Superfly</em> that were also known for bringing in such top musicians as Curtis Mayfield, Marvin Gaye and Isaac Hayes to work on the soundtracks.</p><p>Many of Hollywood&#x27;s versions were exaggerated crime dramas, replete with pimps and drug dealers, which drew heavy criticism in both the white and Black press.</p><p>&quot;What Hollywood did — they suppressed the political message, added caricature — and blaxploitation was born,&quot; Van Peebles said in 2002. &quot;The coloured intelligentsia were not too happy about it.&quot;</p><p>In fact, civil rights groups like the NAACP and the Congress of Racial Equality coined the phrase blaxploitation and formed the Coalition Against Blaxploitation. Among the genre&#x27;s 21st-century fans was Quentin Tarantino, whose Oscar-winning <em>Django Unchained</em> was openly influenced by blaxploitation films and spaghetti westerns.</p><p>On Wednesday, a younger generation of Black filmmakers mourned Van Peebles&#x27;s death. Barry Jenkins, the <em>Moonlight</em> director, said on Twitter: &quot;He made the most of every second, of EVERY single damn frame.&quot;</p><p><div><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Embed  | Miscellaneous"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Embed  | Miscellaneous</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY"> </p></div></div></div><div><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Embed  | Miscellaneous"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Embed  | Miscellaneous</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY"> </p></div></div></div><div><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Embed  | Miscellaneous"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Embed  | Miscellaneous</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY"> </p></div></div></div></p><h2>From Broadway to Wall Street</h2><p>After his initial success, Van Peebles was bombarded with directing offers, but he chose to maintain his independence.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;ll only work with them on my terms,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;ve whipped the man&#x27;s ass on his own turf. I&#x27;m No. 1 at the box office — which is the way America measures things — and I did it on my own. Now they want me, but I&#x27;m in no hurry.&quot;</p><p>Van Peebles then got involved on Broadway, writing and producing several plays and musicals, including the Tony-nominated <em>Ain&#x27;t Supposed to Die a Natural Death</em> and <em>Don&#x27;t Play Us Cheap</em>. He later wrote the movie <em>Greased Lighting</em> starring Richard Pryor as Wendell Scott, the first Black race car driver.</p><p>In the 1980s, Van Peebles turned to Wall Street and options trading.

(Michel Spingler/The Associated Press)</p></div></div></p><p>Born Melvin Peebles in Chicago on Aug. 21, 1932, he would later add &quot;Van&quot; to his name. He graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1953 and joined the air force, serving as a navigator for three years.</p><p>After military service, he moved to Mexico and worked as a portrait painter, followed by a move to San Francisco, where he started writing short stories and making short films.</p><p>Van Peebles soon went to Hollywood, but he was only offered a job as a studio elevator operator. Disappointed, he moved to Holland to take graduate courses in astronomy while also studying at the Dutch National Theatre.</p><p>Eventually he gave up his studies and moved to Paris, where he learned he could join the French directors&#x27; guild if he adapted his own work written in French. He quickly taught himself the language and wrote several novels, one of which he made into a feature film.</p><p><em>La Permission/The Story of the Three Day Pass</em> was the tale of an affair between a Black U.S. soldier and a French woman. It won the critic&#x27;s choice award at the San Francisco film festival in 1967, and Van Peebles gained Hollywood&#x27;s attention.</p><p>The following year, he was hired to direct and write the score for <em>Watermelon Man</em>, the tale of a white bigot (played by comic Godfrey Cambridge in white face) who wakes up one day as a Black man.</p><p>With money earned from the project, Van Peebles went to work on <em>Sweet Sweetback&#x27;s Baadasssss Song</em>.</p><p>Van Peebles&#x27; death came just days before the New York Film Festival is to celebrate him with a 50th anniversary of <em>Sweet Sweetback&#x27;s Baadasssss Song</em>. Next week, the Criterion Collection is to release the box set <em>Melvin Van Peebles: Essential Films</em>. A revival of his play <em>Ain&#x27;t Supposed to Die a Natural Death</em> is also planned to hit Broadway next year, with Mario Van Peebles serving as creative producer.</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
