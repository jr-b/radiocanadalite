It includes leaving or placing an attractant, such as garbage, in any park in a manner that attracts or could attract wildlife.</p><p>The bylaw would include all wildlife in city parks including amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals that are not domestic animals or pets.</p><p>&quot;This new bylaw would apply to all wildlife because feeding even small animals increases the amount of prey available for dangerous wildlife, which have greater potential risk to humans,&quot; reads <a href="https://parkboardmeetings.vancouver.ca/2021/20210927/REPORT-ParkBoardBylawUpdates-FeedingWildlifeParks-20210927.pdf">the report<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> prepared by staff for commissioners.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6165332">If you are upset about coyotes being killed in Vancouver, help prevent wildlife feeding, say experts</a></li></ul></p><p>Current park bylaws prohibit leaving food in any area in a park except garbage cans, but they do not specifically address the direct feeding of wildlife or outline deterrent fines that can be issued, according to the report.</p><p>Under the <a href="https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96488_01#section33.1">B.C.

I thought I just couldn&#x27;t leave out food for coyotes,&#x27; &quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;I think that it&#x27;s good that there&#x27;s just one easy to rule to follow.&quot;</p><h2>How to enforce?</h2><p>Shroff questions how the park board will enforce the fines without adding more patrols in places like Stanley Park.</p><p>The park board report says enforcement of the new bylaws &quot;would require additional staff resources and impact overall operating costs.&quot;</p><p></p><p>Irwin said the park board will look at how to deploy park rangers so they can enforce the new bylaw. </p><p>However, during the park board meeting on Monday night, staff made it clear to commissioners that park rangers do not have the authority under the Police Act to ask for identification in order to hand out fines and that the issue of enforcement would require further examination.</p><p>Animal advocate Leslie Fox, executive director of the group Fur-Bearers, spoke at the meeting and supported the bylaw but pushed for higher fines.</p><p>Other interventions to stop future aggressive coyote attacks in Stanley Park include signs around the park asking that people not feed wildlife and the installation of more secure garbage cans.</p><p>Any instances of aggressive coyotes or the feeding of wild animals can be reported to the Conservation Officer Service at 1-877-952-7277.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6189949">Meet the &#x27;park warriors&#x27; whose mission is to call out wildlife feeding in Vancouver</a></li></ul></p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
