One of the challenges was distinguishing the impact of roads themselves on birds from that of traffic.</p><p>While out for a drive early in the pandemic, she says she was struck by how quiet it was and realized it was an opportunity to look at the impact of the traffic itself on birds.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Bald Eagle"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Bald Eagle</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Bald eagles moved to areas with the strongest lockdowns, data from eBird showed.  (CBC)</p></div></div></p><p>While most of her previous work involved directly observing birds in the field, lockdowns made that impossible this time. So she turned to data on eBird, which she had been contributing to as a volunteer &quot;for fun&quot; for years.</p><p>One challenge was that people&#x27;s birding habits also changed during the lockdowns — they tended to watch birds more from their backyards or balconies in the city compared with before, and there were a lot of new birders.</p><p>Researchers like Wesley Hochachka, a senior research associate at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca, N.Y., had<a href="https://ebird.org/news/pandemic-related-changes-in-birding-may-have-consequences-for-ebird-research"><u> already warned other scientists</u><img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> about how that changed the nature of eBird data compared with data from previous years.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5739534">Sparrows sing &#x27;sexier,&#x27; more complex mating songs during lockdown: study</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6091882">Noisy, showy cardinals reproducing more thanks to your birdseed</a></li></ul></p><p>Koper and her collaborators, including Hochachka&#x27;s Cornell colleague Alison Johnston, did their best to account and correct for that by doing things like comparing the same locations before and during the pandemic and excluding records from new birders who didn&#x27;t use eBird before the pandemic.</p><p>Hochachka, who is Canadian but wasn&#x27;t involved in the new study, said in many cases, that had been done reasonably or very well, and he agrees that it looks like some species did increase in urban areas.</p><p>But he thinks with other species, it&#x27;s possible they simply changed their behaviour, such as by singing more or hiding less, &quot;so that they become more visible or more audible by human observers.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | 1764831182"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | 1764831182</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: A Wilson&#x27;s warbler sits on a rope.
