John is now focusing on Sole Waterloo and Melville Cafe Cambridge.</p><h2>Open for business</h2><p>Happily, there are lots of openings that outnumber closures. Here is a selection.<br/> <br/> In Cambridge, indoor dining re-opens at Little Mushroom Dining Lounge.

Look for them to re-open at the end of month.</p><p>With grocery stores needed — to add to Full Circle Grocery &amp; Bulk — Marche Leo&#x27;s has opened at the corner of King and Water in downtown Kitchener.

Cameron says she features by-the-glass natural and low-intervention wines, and lots from Ontario. It opens this week.</p><p>In a time of restricted seating, it&#x27;s great to see a small venue, Pho Vietnam K &amp; W, expand and assume next-door space at its location at King and Cedar streets.</p><p>Popular cook Terry Salmond, formerly of Charcoal Group, is preparing to open Lighthouse Cafe and Bistro in the former Cafe Pyrus space on Charles Street — now that Pyrus has hopped over to King Street at Water Street. Salmond calls it &quot;regional Canadian&quot; and for now the opening date is unknown.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6147407">As food costs rise, restaurants plate up Waterloo region produce: Andrew Coppolino</a></li></ul></p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s just me and my partner working on it.

While Desi Bites Indian appears to be opening on Kingsway Drive at Wilson Avenue — it will include some Hakka Chinese-Indian dishes.</p><p>Popular U.S. chain Chick-fil-A opened on Fairway Road in early August, but amidst controversy over the ownership&#x27;s polarizing social views. It&#x27;s said to be great chicken, but I will probably stick with the local home-grown versions.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Madhu&#x27;s Roti and Doubles"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Madhu&#x27;s Roti and Doubles</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Madhu&#x27;s Roti and Doubles recently had a grand opening on Fischer-Hallman Road.

The small window to the side remains Scoop du Jour take-away ice cream.</p><p>Babylon Sisters has opened at 23 King Street North in Waterloo. It features non-LCBO labels and wines by female producers. Food is by S &amp; V Uptown a few doors down, which moved from their Lancaster Street location in late summer.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Babylon Sisters"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Babylon Sisters</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Babylon Sisters has opened at 23 King Street North in Waterloo.

They have a Cuban-style sandwich I wouldn&#x27;t mind trying.</p><p>Heading to Belmont Village, long-time Cambridge restaurateur-cook Pirooz Jafari is moving from beautiful old Galt to the former Wilhelm&#x27;s spot. Jafari draws on his Iranian background as he cooks classic bistro dishes such as coq au vin.</p><h2>Go where the cooks go</h2><p>Speaking of moving, cooks move around — at the best of times it can be a mobile and transient work force.</p><p>Rich Hodge and Tara Robinson have left Grand Trunk Saloon. The former is at Laurier&#x27;s student union as kitchen manager-chef. The latter is at Laurier&#x27;s Veritas Cafe. Assuming cooking duties at GTS is Maria Sherwood, formerly of Public, and Jared Penner, who came from Toronto.</p><p>Just around the corner at TWH Social in the Walper Hotel, Abbey Rush has moved from Proof to become restaurant manager. She&#x27;s a cocktail maven who will be creating new fall beverages, which will include the first honey from the roof-top Walper hive.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6140113">Three Sisters garden food shares deep roots with Indigenous community: Andrew Coppolino</a></li></ul></p><p>This summer Jenn Angus-Parkin became head chef at Red House, while Red House alum and cook Spencer Vella returns to the region from Stratford to assume butcher duties at Stone Crock.</p><p>In a Waterloo Region-Perth County swap, heading to Stratford and the HUB is Jaret Flannigan, formerly of S &amp; V Uptown and Imperial Market New Hamburg.</p><p>While former S &amp; V&#x27;s chef Denis Hernandez takes over the kitchen in Stratford&#x27;s Windsor Hotel.</p><p>In other news, Taylor Jones has created a film series on businesses surviving the pandemic, including some food businesses. Check the Princess Cinema for details.</p><p>Crafty Ramen is looking for more production space so it can open its dining room again, according to owner Jared Ferrall.</p><p>He adds that the restaurant will be catering an event for the Toronto Film Festival as it screens a Japanese movie about a ramen shop called <em>Come Back Anytime</em>.</p><p>A Wellesley business is about to launch Nithwood Reserve, a barrel-aged maple syrup.</p><p>Langdon Hall chef Jason Bangerter will launch a cookbook this fall, which was delayed by COVID-19. It will be published by Penguin Random House.</p><p>While the final damage from the pandemic is still likely to be tallied, and instability will continue as patios close for the winter, subsidies subside and post-holiday doldrums kick in, these openings augur well.</p><p>The agglomeration of food businesses in many parts of the region — enhanced by more walkable urban neighbourhoods — creates small food hubs that are attractive to diners and customers. If one business does well, a nearby business has a chance too: the rising tide lifts all boats.</p><p>We hope.</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
