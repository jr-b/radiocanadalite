(Tina MacKenzie/CBC)</p></div></div></div><div><p>When Matt Fuchs needed money to hire a home-care worker for his 82-year-old mother, who has dementia, he figured getting a line of credit based on the equity in her house would be easy.</p><p>After all, the Toronto home was mostly paid off.</p><p>Instead, the application was denied over a $12,500 lien on the property for home heating and cooling equipment. Fuchs says he and his mother knew nothing about it. The lien was later increased to more than $15,000.</p><p>Fuchs says the lien was put there after a company called Nationwide Home Comfort showed up at Mercedes Chacin de Fuchs&#x27;s door in 2017 and convinced her to sign a 10-year rental contract for a furnace and air conditioner.</p><p>&quot;They came in and convinced somebody that has cognitive issues that they needed something they didn&#x27;t need,&quot; Fuchs told Go Public.</p><p>He says his mom, who also has Parkinson&#x27;s disease, told him the salesperson said the company was part of a provincial environmental program that saves homeowners money.</p><ul>   <li><strong>Got a story?

No doubt,&quot; Fuchs told Go Public. &quot;Later, when<em><strong> </strong></em>I found out that this was a widespread problem across Canada, I got even more disgusted.&quot;</p><p>Tens of thousands of Canadians are locked into similar &quot;unconscionable&quot; deals, says paralegal John Robinson, who fights such contracts in court, including that of Fuchs and his mom.</p><p>How it works, according to Robinson, is an HVAC company sells the contracts, mostly to seniors, people with disabilities or those with English as a second language. Then a different company buys that contract and starts collecting the monthly payments — providing &quot;financing.&quot;</p><p>That way, Robinson says, the financing company can say it had nothing to do with how the contracts were signed.</p><p>Those companies then slap liens on the property for the equipment, usually right away, that often aren&#x27;t discovered by the homeowners until they go to sell or refinance, he says. </p><p>In tiny print and written in legalese, Chacin de Fuchs&#x27;s contract says the company has &quot;the right to register a security interest&quot; on the property and that the owner waives the right to get a copy of the registration.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | HVAC contract flow chart graphic"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | HVAC contract flow chart graphic</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">  (Wendy Martinez/CBC)</p></div></div></p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Embed  | Miscellaneous"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Embed  | Miscellaneous</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY"> </p></div></div></p><p>Robinson says land title departments in some cities allow companies to register security interests, or liens, without informing homeowners.</p><p>The HVAC companies &quot;don&#x27;t [inform owners] because if they did, no one would agree to these agreements. No one would sign them,&quot; Robinson said.</p><p>It&#x27;s a convoluted web of companies, he says, that often make a lot of money off the backs of the most vulnerable.</p><p>Less than a month after Chacin de Fuchs signed, her contract was taken over by a financing company called Home Trust, which slapped a $12,500 lien on the property.</p><p>A year later, in November 2018, the contract was sold to Crown Crest Capital, which replaced the first lien with its own security interest for more than $15,000.</p><h2>Few answers</h2><p>Getting answers from some of the companies is tough. Go Public found a lot of their websites are shut down, the phone numbers are out of service, and the emails bounce back.</p><p>Home Trust didn&#x27;t reply to Go Public&#x27;s repeated requests for comment. Nationwide Home Comfort is no longer operating, according to its former director Roman Berson, who now heads up two other HVAC companies.</p><p><strong><em>WATCH | Woman with dementia locked into 10-year home-heating contract:</em></strong></p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Media Video | Son sues after mother with dementia locked into 10-year home heating contract | Go Public"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Media Video | Son sues after mother with dementia locked into 10-year home heating contract | Go Public</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: A son has filed a lawsuit after he says his mother, who has dementia, was locked into a 10-year home heating contract despite her cognitive issues and resulted in a company placing a lien on her home. </p></div></div></p><p>He says any claim of misrepresentation by the salesperson is &quot;completely false&quot; — Berson says Chacin de Fuchs invited the representative into her home by booking an appointment and that their vehicle was clearly marked with the Nationwide logo.</p><p>He says all Nationwide&#x27;s contracts now belong to Crown Crest Capital and another company.</p><p>Crown Crest Capital, owned by Simply Group — a major player in the HVAC industry — said in an email to Go Public it has &quot;worked so hard to counter bad practices&quot; in the industry and has supported consumer protection reforms.</p><p>&quot;Sometimes, customers facing financial challenges try to renege on their commitments after years of complaint-free leasing by claiming to have been misled at the time they signed up,&quot; wrote vice president of customer experience Tasleemah Ladak.</p><p>The Fuchs family is suing the companies involved.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Matt Fuchs, left, and his mother Mercedes Chacin de Fuchs"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Matt Fuchs, left, and his mother Mercedes Chacin de Fuchs</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Matt Fuchs says he discovered the $15,000 lien on his mom&#x27;s home years after she signed the contract.   (Tina MacKenzie/CBC)</p></div></div></p><p>In its statement of defence, Crown Crest Capital denies all allegations, saying it is only the financial institution that took on the contract after it was signed.</p><p>In her email, Ladak also says less than 0.01 per cent of its accounts end up in litigation. The company would not say how many customers it has.<strong> </strong></p><p>Ladak also said Crown Crest Capital does not have any liens on properties but instead registers &quot;interest in the leased equipment&quot; so future homeowners know the equipment won&#x27;t automatically become theirs.<strong> </strong></p><p>Robinson calls that last point &quot;semantics&quot; saying, &quot;it makes no difference what you call it, everyone knows what a lien is … it&#x27;s the same thing.&quot;</p><p>Crown Crest Capital also says it regrets the Fuchs sued before reaching out to the company directly.</p><p>Another family, Joddy Prevost and his wife Cherie Prevost of Tillsonburg, Ont., found liens of almost $17,000 on his dad&#x27;s property after Norm Prevost passed away in November 2019.

Neither Ontario Energy Savings nor Utilebill responded to Go Public&#x27;s questions.</p><h2>Fix is failing</h2><p>Robinson, the paralegal, says such liens hold consumers hostage because people who sell or refinance their homes have no choice but to pay out the contract if they want to remove the lien.</p><p>Consumer protection agencies<em> </em>across the country have received over 2,000 complaints about HVAC contracts in the last five years.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | John Robinson Paralegal "><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | John Robinson Paralegal </p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Paralegal John Robinson says governments need to do a lot more to protect consumers against certain home heating and cooling companies.
