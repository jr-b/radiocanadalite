Try exercise, pay attention to your posture, try a warm compress first... if that does not help, then you can consider taking Tylenol.&quot;</p><p></p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
