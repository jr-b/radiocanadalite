Their symptoms are worse because their immune systems go into overdrive,&quot; Dubé said. </p><p>About 80 per cent of 12- to 17-year-olds have a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, province-wide. In Montreal, that number drops to 70 per cent and to 77 per cent in Laval. </p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6152926">Montreal public health director says city already seeing steeper rise in cases than last fall</a></li></ul></p><p>Meanwhile, in the Quebec City and Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean regions, it rises to 87 per cent. </p><p>The rate of a first dose across eligible age groups is at 86 per cent, and 79 per cent for those who&#x27;ve received a second dose.</p><p>Vaccination will soon be offered in and around schools, Dubé said, where parents can also get their shot.</p><h2>Rapid tests for schools in &#x27;hot zones&#x27;</h2><p>A number of schools in neighbourhoods considered &quot;hot zones,&quot; with increasing cases and low vaccination rates in Montreal and Laval, will receive rapid tests. They include Montréal-Nord, Saint-Michel and Parc-Extension in Montreal and Chomedey in Laval. </p><p>Calling September a &quot;critical&quot; month, Dubé said the province would send the tests to schools outside those areas if need be. </p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6153897">Quebec hospital staff wearing down as the unvaccinated crowd ICUs</a></li></ul></p><p>Dubé confirmed Quebec would be pushing ahead with its <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6143862">plan to make vaccination mandatory</a> for all health-care workers. Ninety-one per cent Quebec&#x27;s health-care workers have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and 84 per cent are adequately vaccinated. </p><p>Both he and Arruda stressed the importance of getting vaccinated amid the fourth wave. </p><p>&quot;Will there be a new variant? Will that variant respond to the vaccine? Will we have to give everyone a third dose? I can&#x27;t predict these things, but I can say that in the short term, vaccination is the solution,&quot; Arruda said. </p><h2>Vaccine passport coming tomorrow</h2><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Quebec-Vaccine-Passport-250821"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Quebec-Vaccine-Passport-250821</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: The Quebec government&#x27;s new vaccine passport can be shown with an app, as a PDF or in print.
