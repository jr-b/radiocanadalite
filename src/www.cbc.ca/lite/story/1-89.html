Finally, these tapes are going to be heard,&#x27;&quot; Martin said in an interview in Winnipeg.</p><h2>From Winnipeg to the Wedding Album</h2><p>Martin said his brother was &quot;fiercely proud&quot; of his roots in the Manitoba city, where he grew up in the North End and became a teacher before moving to London and studying journalism and filmmaking.</p><p>Ken&#x27;s work took him across Canada and the world over a span of several decades, including jobs at CBC, Martin said. He died of cancer in Winnipeg in 1990.</p><p>Martin said he&#x27;s glad the unaired tapes are finally going to be shared, and that people will know &quot;it was a journalist who was originally from Winnipeg who did these amazing interviews.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Long-lost interview tapes of John Lennon and Yoko Ono from Ken Zeilig"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Long-lost interview tapes of John Lennon and Yoko Ono from Ken Zeilig</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: One of the reel-to-reel tapes up for auction is pictured.  (Omega Auctions)</p></div></div></p><p>Leo said getting to listen to the tapes more than 30 years after his father&#x27;s death was surreal.</p><p>In one of the interviews, he said, his father told the couple how much their <em>Wedding Album</em>, which had just come out, meant to him and his wife at the time — Leo&#x27;s mother.</p><p>&quot;There&#x27;s this wonderful meeting of the three of them at that point in the interview when they&#x27;re all expressing their feelings about love and sharing a life of being together,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;And, of course, to hear it about your parents in an interview with John Lennon and Yoko Ono is extraordinary.&quot;</p><h2>A &#x27;tenacious&#x27; journalist</h2><p>Ken&#x27;s family says they&#x27;re not sure why only a few minutes of audio from the tapes was ever aired anywhere. </p><p>They also don&#x27;t know exactly how the journalist was able to lock down not just one, but three interviews with the famous duo at their home in 1969 and 1970 — right before The Beatles broke up.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5831222">Why the Beatles remain relevant 50 years after breaking up</a></li></ul></p><p>But knowing Ken, they&#x27;re not surprised, either.</p><p>&quot;My father was exceptionally tenacious, so if he wanted an interview, [he&#x27;d] get it.

He was very forceful, but not in a sort of hostile way. And he was interested. He was very interested in people,&quot; Martin said.</p><p>&quot;He had this capacity to draw things out of people that they might not otherwise say to anyone else.&quot;</p><h2>More auctions possible</h2><p>Ken&#x27;s family says they&#x27;re interested to see who goes home with the tapes after they&#x27;re auctioned off.</p><p>And with the money from the impending sale, Leo said he hopes they&#x27;ll be able to digitize and auction off the originals of more of his father&#x27;s &quot;astonishing&quot; back catalogue of recently discovered interviews.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5529669">Handwritten lyrics for Beatles&#x27; song Hey Jude sell for $910K at auction</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.4935771">When the world learned that John Lennon was gone</a></li></ul></p><p>&quot;Every major cultural, political figure of the 1960s, &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s, my father interviewed,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s incredibly rich, from Alfred Hitchcock to Audrey Hepburn.&quot;</p><p>Ken Zeilig&#x27;s interviews with John Lennon and Yoko Ono will be auctioned on Tuesday.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Media Video | Canadian’s rediscovered John Lennon interview going up for auction"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Media Video | Canadian’s rediscovered John Lennon interview going up for auction</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: The tapes of some long-forgotten interviews with John Lennon and Yoko Ono done by a Canadian journalist are going up for auction in the U.K. The 91 minutes of audio recording could fetch more than $50,000. </p></div></div></p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
