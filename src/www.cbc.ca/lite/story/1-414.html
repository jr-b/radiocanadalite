Prior to the Meng case, Canada and China had a relatively good trade relationship despite pressure from the U.S. to join it in banning the use of <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.4953974">Chinese technology, notably Huawei&#x27;s 5G telecom systems</a>.</p><p>That pressure was seen by some experts as part of the U.S. government&#x27;s growing<a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/technology/video/is-canada-caught-in-the-middle-of-a-china-u-s-tech-war~1561828"><u> technology cold war</u><img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> that seeks to boost support for U.S. companies at the expense of their Chinese competitors, whom members of Congress, later <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/the-threat-posed-by-the-chinese-government-and-the-chinese-communist-party-to-the-economic-and-national-security-of-the-united-states"><u>supported by the FBI</u><img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a>, have accused of industrial espionage.</p><h2>Good relations abused?</h2><p>Canada&#x27;s relationship with Huawei was complicated by the fact the company has such a foothold here, with operations staffed by many former employees of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-07-01/did-china-steal-canada-s-edge-in-5g-from-nortel"><u>defunct Canadian rival Nortel.</u><img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a></p><p>Canada has a strong extradition law with the United States to prevent people accused of crimes from avoiding justice across the border. Some observers suspect the former U.S. administration led by Donald Trump exploited that strong relationship to weaken Canada&#x27;s ties with China.<ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6182507">Fear grips markets as China&#x27;s Evergrande struggles with massive debt</a></li></ul></p><p>&quot;It depends how cynical you are,&quot; said Houlden, who has worked in China and is well connected in Washington, D.C. &quot;Some would say by putting a spike in Canada-China relations, which the Meng Wanzhou extradition case certainly did, that may well have served U.S. strategic interests as well.&quot;<div><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | AFP_1BD7CC"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | AFP_1BD7CC</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: The Chinese company Huawei has deep ties with Canada, partly because it hired many workers from defunct Canadian telecom Nortel.  (Fred Dufour/AFP/Getty Images)</p></div></div></div></p><p>Despite the fact that business between Canada and China continued to grow throughout the worst of the political conflict, experts say business relations were damaged in a number of ways. For example, some Canadian executives were afraid to travel to China.</p><p>There were deals that didn&#x27;t get done, and Chinese companies became wary of investing in Canada. And while trade in agricultural goods saw only slight interruptions, high-tech collaboration became very difficult.</p><h2>From lost deals to irritants</h2><p>Besides the loss of investment and bigger trade deals, the dispute with China has been a constant irritant for many Canadian companies. Take, for example, the recent fines imposed on coat-maker <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6168160">Canada Goose</a> for mislabelling, something that might have been resolved in a friendlier way.</p><p>In Canada, 64 per cent of GDP is generated by trade. That compares with 37 per cent for China and only 24 per cent for the U.S.</p><p>&quot;We are highly trade dependent, and shutting off from what is almost the largest economy economy on Earth — it depends on how you count it, it may be already but it certainly will be shortly — is a very high cost for a country like Canada,&quot; said Houlden.<div><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Canada Goose 20180809"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Canada Goose 20180809</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Coat-maker Canada Goose was recently fined by China for allegedly misleading consumers about the materials it uses. The company says a technical error on a partner website was behind confusion about its products&#x27; materials, and the error was quickly corrected.  (Aaron Vincent Elkaim/The Canadian Press)</p></div></div></div></p><p>In some ways, the deferred prosecution agreement in the U.S. that led to Meng being set free after pleading not guilty could bolster China&#x27;s case that it was all politics to begin with.</p><p>That doesn&#x27;t weaken the Canadian argument that, once the extradition process began in good faith, Canadian courts and the Canadian government were compelled to follow the rule of law. That remains a Canadian strength. However, this latest U.S.-China deal may help deepen the impression that the U.S. had been willing to sacrifice good faith ties with Canada for political advantage.<ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.4953974">Trump&#x27;s Huawei threat a risk to Canadian and global tech in 2019: Don Pittis</a></li></ul></p><p>Houlden said once both Meng and the Michaels were free, Canada could begin to mend its trade and business relations with China. It seems that time is now. Though Houlden suggested other irritants will likely persist.</p><p>In many ways, the damage has already been done. A wedge has been driven between Canadian business and the huge Asian economy.</p><p>&quot;It doesn&#x27;t mean the relationship springs back to where it was,&quot; said Houlden.</p><p>Follow Don on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/don_pittis">@don_pittis<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a></p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
