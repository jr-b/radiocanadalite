(The Moab Police Department via AP)</p></div></div></p><p>The couple had documented aspects of their trip on social media platforms, including Instagram and TikTok, as part of the &quot;van life&quot; trend, which sees people let go of their possessions in order to live a life on the road. </p><p>Evidence suggests Laundrie returned alone from the trip on Sept. 1, and Petito&#x27;s family reported her missing on Sept. 11.</p><p>Days later, Laundrie also disappeared. </p><p>Human remains believed to belong to Petito were found in a national forest in Wyoming on Sept. 19, and a forensic report released on Sept. 21 confirmed that was the case.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Missing Traveler"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Missing Traveler</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: This photo provided by North Port Police Department, law enforcement officials conduct a search of the vast Carlton Reserve in the Sarasota, Fla., area for Laundrie on Sept. 18.
