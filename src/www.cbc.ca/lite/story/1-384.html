Centre for Disease Control said the flu shot is expected to be widely available mid-October.</p><p>Symptoms of influenza — fever, cough, sore throat, head and muscle aches — can be similar to those of the much more lethal COVID-19. </p><p>Dr. Ross Chang, past president of the B.C. Society of Allergy and Immunology, said people should seek a COVID-19 test if they are at all concerned.</p><p>&quot;I think that any kind of infection with fever that persists certainly deserves a COVID test,&quot; he said. &quot;COVID infections have a whole range, so patients can be infected with COVID and be asymptomatic.&quot;</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5893936">Why is there no flu amid so many COVID cases? Your COVID-19 questions answered</a></li></ul></p><p>For those people yet to be vaccinated against COVID-19, Chang suggests leaving one to two weeks between a COVID shot and the flu jab in order to manage any side-effects.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s important not to get them at the same time — not because they interact, but because the adverse effects can be very similar,&quot; he said. </p><p>With COVID-19 still circulating widely, Conway said it&#x27;s even more critical that people be immunized against both COVID and the flu.</p><p>&quot;It will reduce the amount of disease that spreads in the community — both influenza and COVID —  and reduce the number of people that have to interact with the health-care system,&quot; he said.</p><p>Two companies, Moderna Inc. and Novavax Inc., have announced they are working on a <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6169305">combined flu and COVID-19 vaccine</a>, which Conway believes will be the future.</p><p>&quot;There&#x27;s the expectation in many circles that COVID is going to be around for a while. Flu, obviously, has been around for a while and will be around and we&#x27;re just going to be vaccinating people for both on a yearly basis,&quot; he said. </p><p>&quot;But for now, please run and get your flu shot.&quot;</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
