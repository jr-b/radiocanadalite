(New Brunswick Medical Society)</p></div></div></div><div><p>Doctors play a crucial role in addressing the public&#x27;s concerns about getting vaccinated against COVID-19, the president of the New Brunswick Medical Society says.</p><p>Many New Brunswickers have accepted they need to get the vaccine, but almost 12 per cent haven&#x27;t had a single dose.</p><p>Dr. Jeff Steeves says he&#x27;s hearing that some people won&#x27;t get the vaccine because they&#x27;re worried it isn&#x27;t safe. Others don&#x27;t believe there is a COVID-19 pandemic, and some say requiring people to be vaccinated would violate their rights and liberties.</p><p>But when people don&#x27;t get the vaccine, Steeves said, they infringe on the rights of the rest of the population. </p><p>Steeves said six billion doses of vaccine have been administered worldwide, and it&#x27;s been well-studied.</p><p>&quot;We know it&#x27;s safe and effective,&quot; he said. &quot;This vaccine is not new.&quot;  </p><p>Steeves, an ophthalmologist, said that when he sees patients, he asks whether they&#x27;ve received a vaccine. The one-on-one conversations with patients allow doctors to share more information about the vaccine and address concerns people are having.</p><p> &quot;I feel pretty good when people leave and say, &#x27;Ah, I got it now, I trust what you&#x27;re saying.&#x27;&quot; </p><p>In New Brunswick, the province requires people to provide proof <a href="1-44.html">of vaccination at most non-essential businesses.</a></p><h2><strong>Vaccine exemptions not likely</strong></h2><p>Although doctors haven&#x27;t been inundated with requests, Steeves said, some people do ask their doctors for an exemption from the vaccine. And when they&#x27;re denied, he said, people leave the doctor&#x27;s office angry and disappointed and can also be &quot;verbally abusive&quot; toward their doctor. </p><p>But the grounds for an exemption from the COVID-19 vaccine are &quot;very narrow.&quot;</p><p>People can be exempt if they had a severe allergic reaction to the first COVID dose and have seen an allergist who says the patient &quot;can&#x27;t move forward to get a vaccine.&quot; Another exemption would be the vaccine coincides with the timing of chemotherapy.</p><p>&quot;These would be very rare.&quot;</p><p>Steeves said the COVID-19 vaccines are 70 to 95 per cent effective. But when everyone gets the vaccine, it&#x27;s even more effective. </p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s a shared responsibility that we all have to get vaccinated.&quot;</p><h2><strong>86 new COVID cases</strong></h2><p>New Brunswick reported 86 new cases of COVID-19 on Monday, the highest one-day total since the pandemic began.</p><p>Forty-one people are now in hospital, up from 33 on Sunday, including 16 in intensive care. None of them are under the age of 19, Public Health said in a news release.</p><p>There are now 650 active cases of COVID across the province.</p><h2><strong>New public exposure notices</strong></h2><p>Public Health has identified new places where people may have been exposed to the coronavirus over the past two weeks.</p><p><strong>Moncton region, Zone 1</strong></p><ul>   <li>Sept. 20 and Sept. 24 between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. – <strong>Route 16 Diner </strong>(4335 Route 16, Malden)</li>   <li>Sept. 19 between 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. – <strong>TH Sports Group, Sports Complex </strong>(184 Barker St., Moncton)</li>   <li>Sept. 16 between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. – <strong>Sephora</strong> (477 Paul St., Dieppe)</li>   <li>Sept. 16 between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. –<strong> H&amp;M </strong>(477 Paul St., Dieppe)</li>   <li>Sept. 16 between 10:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. – <strong>Arbys </strong>(1029 Mountain Rd., Moncton)</li>  </ul><p><strong>Saint John region, Zone 2</strong></p><ul>   <li>Sept. 20 between 1:30 p.m. and 3 p.m. – <strong>Holy Rosary Catholic Church </strong>(5 Rose St., St. Stephen)</li>  </ul><p><strong>Fredericton region, Zone 3</strong></p><ul>   <li>Sept. 26 between 10 a.m. and noon – <strong>Truth Temple Inc </strong>(2930 Williamstown Rd., Centreville)</li>   <li>Sept. 23 and 24 – <strong>Days Inn Hotel </strong>(60 Brayson Blvd., Oromocto)</li>   <li>Sept. 23 – <strong>Corrective Health Services </strong>(435 Brookside Dr., Fredericton)</li>   <li>Sept. 22 and 23 between 8 a.m. and noon – <strong>Gateway Dental Centre </strong>(22 Commerce Dr., Oromocto)</li>   <li>September 16 between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m.<strong> – Vaccination clinic Perth Andover Baptist Church </strong>(194 Barrett St., Perth-Andover)</li>  </ul><p><strong>Edmundston region, Zone 4</strong></p><ul>   <li>Sept. 22 between 12:30 p.m. and 2 p.m. –<strong> Bonichoix (</strong>4 Camille St., Kedgwick)</li>   <li>Sept. 20 between 1:30 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. –<strong> Léopold Roy House (</strong>212 Canada St., Saint Quentin)</li>   <li>Sept. 20 between noon and 1 p.m. – <strong>Burger King </strong>(100 Broadway Blvd., Grand Falls</li>   <li>Sept. 20 between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. –<strong> Hilltop</strong> (131 Madawaska Rd., Grand Falls)</li>   <li>Sept. 20 between noon and 1 p.m. –<strong> Bonichoix (</strong>4 Camille St., Kedgwick)</li>   <li>Sept. 20 between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. –<strong> Walmart (</strong>494 Madawaska Rd., Grand Falls)</li>   <li>Sept. 20 between 3 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. – <strong>Voting station Eglise St. Jacques </strong>(6 Ecole St., Edmundston)</li>   <li>Sept. 19 between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. –<strong> Walmart (</strong>494 Madawaska Rd., Grand Falls)</li>   <li>Sept. 19 between 4 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. –<strong> Toner Food Master (</strong>328 Tobique Rd., Grand Falls)</li>   <li>Sept. 18 between 9 a.m. and noon –<strong> Final Cuts (</strong>275 Broadway Blvd., Grand Falls)</li>   <li>Sept. 18 between 11 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. –<strong> Walmart (</strong>494 Madawaska Rd., Grand Falls)</li>   <li>Sept. 18 between 11:30 a.m. and noon –<strong> Atlantic Superstore (</strong>240 Madawaska Rd., Grand Falls)</li>  </ul><p><strong>Campbellton region, Zone 5</strong></p><ul>   <li>Sept. 22, 25, and 26<strong> </strong>– <strong>Pseudio Boutique</strong> (312 Val D&#x27;Amour Rd., Campbellton)</li>   <li>Sept. 22 between 11:05 a.m. and noon –<strong> Vaccine Clinic, Campbellton Regional Hospital</strong> (189 Lily Lake Rd., Campbellton)</li>   <li>Sept. 22 between 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. – <strong>Dooly&#x27;s</strong> (81 E Roseberry St., Campbellton)</li>   <li>Sept. 21 between 6 p.m. and midnight – <strong>Dooly&#x27;s</strong> (81 E Roseberry St., Campbellton)</li>  </ul><p>Public Health recommends that people who have been at a possible public exposure site and are not fully vaccinated get a COVID test, even if they don&#x27;t have symptoms.
