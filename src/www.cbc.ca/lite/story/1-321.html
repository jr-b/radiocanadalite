There&#x27;s still a culture in the RCMP and the Canadian Armed Forces that is still very homophobic, transphobic and misogynistic. It&#x27;s going to take a long time to correct that because in 1992, they just changed the official policy.</p><p>&quot;The same people who were persecuting gays and lesbians were still running the show.

Since officially leaving the military in 1995, much of her academic work has centred on the military and the LGBTQ community.
