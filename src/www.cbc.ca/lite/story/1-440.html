Don&#x27;t let it be your tragedy.&quot;</p><p>Biden applauded the recommendation by CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky — who overruled an advisory panel — to include approval of boosters for health-care workers or those who have another job that puts them at increased risk of being exposed to the virus. The panel had limited approval to those over 65 years old and those with underlying health conditions.</p><p>The positive cases also stepped on what was to be a moment in the spotlight for Harris, who had participated in only a handful of televised interviews since taking office. She has come under some scrutiny after some uneven performances in other interviews, and as the administration has taken sharp criticism of images of Border Patrol agents using aggressive tactics against Haitian migrants at the Texas border.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6185965">How COVID-19 was detected in wastewater at 2 UW residences, and why that&#x27;s significant</a></li></ul></p><p>The vice president, whose portfolio includes immigration, acknowledged that the images of Border Patrol agents on horseback, some using the reins of their horses to strike at running migrants, &quot;evoked images of some of the worst moments of our history, where that kind of behavior has been used against the Indigenous people of our country, has been used against African Americans during times of slavery.&quot;</p><p>But she dodged answering whether the administration would stop all deportation of the migrants and allow them to apply for asylum.</p><p>&quot;We have to do more in supporting Haitians who are returning to the island, returning to Haiti,&quot; Harris said. &quot;We have got to do more to support Haiti in terms of its needs to get back up and recover, in terms of the natural disasters.&quot;</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
