University of British Columbia has clarified it will now require all 90,000 of its students, faculty and staff to provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination when declaring their immunization status. </p><p>UBC president Santa Ono <a href="https://twitter.com/ubcprez/status/1434192431692484608"><u>tweeted</u><img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> the announcement Saturday morning, saying that members on campus will be asked to declare that they&#x27;re fully vaccinated and show proof, or undergo regular rapid testing. </p><p>The policy had previously <a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2021/08/26/ubc-implements-vaccine-declaration-and-rapid-testing-for-covid-19/">been limited<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> to disclosing one&#x27;s vaccination status, raising concerns that declarations could be falsified.  </p><p>Ono had <a href="https://twitter.com/ubcprez/status/1433574222232633353">hinted Thursday<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> that self-disclosure would include a &quot;functionality for verification,&quot; although it wasn&#x27;t clear what that would look like. </p><p>Matthew Ramsey, the school&#x27;s director of university affairs, said more information on the rollout would be shared as soon as Tuesday. </p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6155004">At least 5 B.C. universities say disclosure of COVID-19 vaccination status is now required on campus</a></li></ul></p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s a very complex system to design and implement,&quot; he said Saturday. </p><p>He added that the frequency of rapid testing is still being determined. </p><p>B.C.&#x27;s provincial health officer has mandated proof of vaccination for student housing, clubs, varsity sports and other non-essential activities. </p><p>Other major universities in B.C., including Simon Fraser University and the University of Victoria, have said <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6155004"><u>they will ask</u></a> for vaccination statuses. </p><p>It wasn&#x27;t immediately clear Saturday whether they would follow UBC&#x27;s lead and also require proof of vaccination.</p><p><div

per cent of students on the Vancouver campus have received two doses of the vaccine as of Aug. 16. </p><p>About 92 per cent say they have received at least one dose, and the &quot;vast majority&quot; of the remainder said they planned to get vaccinated before the start of classes on Tuesday, Ramsey said.</p><p>He added that the survey was distributed to all incoming students on the Vancouver campus and received about 16,000 responses. </p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6152203">Some B.C. post-secondary students and staff asking province for mandatory vaccine

alt="external"/></a> that 95 per cent of students surveyed at UBC&#x27;s Okanagan campus said they had received both doses. </p><p>That survey was conducted by Interior Health, Ramsey said, but he couldn&#x27;t provide the number of students surveyed or respondents. </p><p>At least one UBC professor cautioned the surveys could suffer from volunteer bias. </p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg"
