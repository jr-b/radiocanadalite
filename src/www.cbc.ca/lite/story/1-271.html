She said those on assistance are treated as though they can&#x27;t be trusted.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | grand parade basic income"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | grand parade basic income</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: People walk through a Halifax rally marking International Basic Income Day.  (Haley Ryan/CBC)</p></div></div></p><p>BIG-NS is part of the national Basic Income Canada Network, which notes there are usually two major models of the strategy.</p><p>One is a universal model, which provides the same benefit amount to everyone, and then those with higher incomes have funds taken back through taxes.</p><p>The second is a guarantee model, which the Nova Scotia group favours, and takes other income into account right away.</p><p>In this model, the person receives the greatest amount when income is very low. When income grows, the amount reduces gradually. Those who have sufficient income from other sources don&#x27;t get a payment.</p><p>Replacing the current social assistance program with a basic income would mean people could finally move into safer housing and buy healthy food, or the little things most people take for granted, said Kay-Raining Bird.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6179760">What is basic income and which of Canada&#x27;s main parties support it?</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5891561">Guaranteed basic income in B.C. not the best way to a more just society, expert panel finds</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.4768626">PC&#x27;s plan to scrap Ontario basic income pilot project called &#x27;shameful&#x27; by NDP leader</a></li></ul></p><p>She added that studies have shown a guaranteed basic income would lift people out of poverty and help them pursue meaningful work — with very little going to non-essential items like alcohol, as critics have suggested.</p><p>Participants in Ontario&#x27;s basic income pilot project in 2017 — which was planned for three years but only ran for one —were happier, healthier and continued working even though they were receiving money with no strings attached, according to a <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5485729">recent report.</a></p><p>The report shows nearly three-quarters of respondents who were working when the pilot project began kept going while receiving basic income.</p><p>Because the cost of living varies across Canada, there&#x27;s no single income level that defines poverty. But generally, advocates have talked about setting guaranteed basic income at around $20,000 a year for a single person between ages of 18 and 64. </p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | basic income chalk drawing"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | basic income chalk drawing</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: A rally attendee creates a chalk drawing during the event.  (Haley Ryan/CBC)</p></div></div></p><p>As someone who relied on provincial disability assistance for years, group member Wayne MacNaughton said being able to tap into Old Age Security benefits and finally get a reliable monthly payment with no strings was a &quot;huge difference.&quot;</p><p>Every Canadian should be able to experience that relief, MacNaughton said, adding that current income assistance programs just aren&#x27;t enough and require people to jump through too many hoops.</p><p>&quot;It gave me some control over my situation,&quot; MacNaughton said.</p><p>Kay-Raining Bird&#x27;s group is calling on the federal and provincial governments to work together on basic income. She said it could be funded in part by a readjustment of the tax system so a greater percentage is paid by those who can afford it.</p><p>There has been &quot;a lot of discussion&quot; about a basic income over the past five years or so, said Kay-Raining Bird, with more conversations at a federal level and <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5844092">Prince Edward Island&#x27;s push</a> for the federal government to contribute funding for a basic income pilot program in the province.</p><p>&quot;This is the sort of thing I think that could be the thin edge of the wedge in implementing the basic income across the country. Other provinces can follow,&quot; she said.</p><p>Two of the<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5158385"> calls for justice</a> in the final report from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls also said Canada should establish a guaranteed livable income for all.</p><p><strong>MORE TOP STORIES</strong> <ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6189752">Woman, 19, dead after single-car crash in Yarmouth County</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6189722">P.E.I.
