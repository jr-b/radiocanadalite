The Black Panthers. Quebec and Canada had the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) — a showdown that dissolved into crisis. By October 1970, there were soldiers in the streets, communities on edge, kidnapping and terror in the headlines. But those frightening weeks were just the crescendo of a wave of terror and violence that was nearly a decade in the making. This series offers immersive storytelling and the voices of the people who lived it: the bomb disposal expert on defusing live explosives, the survivors of terror, their families, and the radicals themselves.

(Ben Shannon/CBC)</p></div></div></p><p><em>Brainwashed </em>investigates the CIA&#x27;s covert mind control experiments — from the Cold War and MKULTRA, to the so-called War on Terror. It&#x27;s the story of how a renowned psychiatrist used his unwitting patients as human guinea pigs at a Montreal hospital, and the ripple effects on survivors, their families, and thousands of other people around the world. It also examines the cultural impact — how the CIA brought LSD to America and inadvertently created counterculture influencers such as author Ken Kesey and poet Allen Ginsberg. It&#x27;s an exploration of what happens in times of fear, when the military and medicine collide. And what happens when the survivors fight back.</p><ul>   <li>Listen to <em>Brainwashed </em><a href="http://smarturl.it/brainwashedcbc"><strong>here</strong><img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a>.</li>   <li>Read more about the podcast <a href="https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/longform/brainwashed-mkultra"><strong>here</strong><img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a>.</li>  </ul></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
