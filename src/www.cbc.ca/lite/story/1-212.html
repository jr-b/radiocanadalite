On July 27, Furness said in an interview with CBC that New Brunswick was heading for trouble if it did not at least maintain rules requiring mask use indoors.</p><p>&quot;People in their 80s are not serving tables in restaurants, they&#x27;re not working as grocery store clerks and they&#x27;re not going to heavy-duty parties. It&#x27;s the ones in their 20s who are. And that group is not protected,&quot; he said</p><p>Furness was not alone in those concerns.</p><p>On July 30, just hours before New Brunswick dropped all of its mandatory public health restrictions, Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada&#x27;s Chief Public Officer of Health, recommended against abandoning masking rules until vaccination rates among the young improved.</p><p>&quot;We have to be cautious about how we reopen,&quot; Tam said in a national briefing about a detected rise in the delta variant in Canada that she said would soon assert itself &quot;in every jurisdiction.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Colin Furness"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Colin Furness</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Colin Furness, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, warned New Brunswick in July that it was courting a COVID-19 outbreak by dropping public health restrictions before raising its vaccination rates.

Continue masking, distancing.&quot; </p><p>In July, the number of those fully vaccinated in New Brunswick between the ages of 18 and 39 was well short of the 80 per cent level Tam said was required to fend off the worst of a &quot;delta driven&quot; wave and is still below 70 per cent. </p><p>Furness said he finds excuses now that warnings were not clear enough in July are not credible.</p><p>&quot;When you looked at the contagiousness of delta, you didn&#x27;t even need to know about vaccine effectiveness.
