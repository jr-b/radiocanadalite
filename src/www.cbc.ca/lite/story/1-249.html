(Liny Lamberink/CBC)</p></div></div></div><div><p>A debate about the location of a temporary day shelter in downtown Yellowknife hits city hall on Monday. </p><p>Councillors are set to discuss the territorial government&#x27;s plans for 4709 Franklin Ave. at a governance and priorities committee meeting, two weeks after <a href="https://www.hss.gov.nt.ca/en/open-letter-community-minister-julie-green">Health Minister Julie Green issued an open letter<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> calling on Yellowknife to support the site. </p><p>Her plea prompted businesses and residents to write a flurry of letters of their own — many voicing frustration, and one calling for compassion. </p><p>Now, city politicians will try to find a path through the fervour as they consider a <a href="https://calendar.yellowknife.ca/Document/View/e4ffcb4a-a34e-4f6b-b185-adad0104441b">memo in the meeting&#x27;s agenda<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> that sheds more light on the territorial government&#x27;s intent for the building, which was most recently used by Aurora Village. </p><p>If approved, the day shelter is expected to operate until Oct. 31, 2024 while the territory&#x27;s health and social services department establishes a new, permanent day shelter and sobering centre on 51st Street, the memo said.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Franklin Ave. Day Shelter building Yellowknife"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Franklin Ave. Day Shelter building Yellowknife</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: A report going to city hall says that if approved the day shelter would operate until the fall of 2024 and would be open every day from 7:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.  (Graham Shishkov/CBC)</p></div></div></p><p>The shelter would be open from 7:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. every day, with a capacity for about 50 people inside. It would complement the existing day shelter and sobering centre on 50th Street.</p><p>The facility would offer its visitors food, entertainment, a washroom, and a safe place to rest and warm up, as well as &quot;entry-level case management,&quot; said the memo. Staff would be trained on de-escalation tactics and trauma-informed approaches, and would also patrol the area and adjacent buildings hourly. </p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6184069">Proposed shelter draws mixed views, appeal plans from Yellowknife businesses</a></li></ul></p><p>The shelter is considered a special care facility, and is therefore a conditionally permitted use of Yellowknife&#x27;s downtown area — but city staff have recommended adding some conditions to the permit. In the memo, they suggest that a review take place more than 90 days before the permit expires, to see if an extension is needed, and to allow the public to weigh in on granting one. </p><p>Staff also recommend a condition that a wheelchair ramp be installed by Nov. 15, 2021.</p><p>Because the shelter would be temporary, the memo says the city may revoke the permit at any time if it&#x27;s considered &quot;detrimental&quot; to the area, and may also adjust the permit&#x27;s time period.</p><h2>Outcry from businesses</h2><p>In a letter addressed to Green on Thursday, the Yellowknife Chamber of Commerce said it was &quot;disappointed and frustrated&quot; with the open letter the health minister issued on Sept. 13. </p><p>&quot;Your language makes clear that you intend on vilifying any opposition to your decision,&quot; said Tim Syer, the chamber&#x27;s president and Deneen Everett, its executive director. &quot;Business owners have valid objections to your decision and they deserve to be heard; this is why the appeals process exists.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Tim Syer"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Tim Syer</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Tim Syer, president of the Yellowknife Chamber of Commerce, said the organization was &#x27;disappointed and frustrated&#x27; with the language of Green&#x27;s letter on Sept. 13.  (Kent Kallberg)</p></div></div></p><p>Green&#x27;s letter, which called on Yellowknife to support the day shelter location, said an appeal would delay the shelter&#x27;s opening by 90 days — meaning its critical services for the underhoused wouldn&#x27;t become available until well into the winter. </p><p>The chamber goes on to say businesses in Yellowknife deserve better communication, while people who are homeless deserve attention and a solution that meets their needs. </p><p>Another letter, written by Geoff Morrison, the director of the Aurora Emporium Art Gallery, was addressed to Premier Caroline Cochrane directly and called 4709 Franklin Ave. an &quot;astonishingly poor&quot; location for a shelter. </p><p>The gallery is inside a neighbouring building, which it shares with the Discovery Inn, the Red Apple Restaurant and the Yellowknife Vineyard Church. </p><p>&quot;We have on several occasions had international tourists seek refuge at our business, having been accosted outside of the premises after day shelters closed,&quot; wrote Morrison. &quot;The public would be better served by leaving the temporary shelter at the local arena,&quot; he said, away from access to drugs and alcohol. </p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Discovery Inn, Christian Vineyard, Aurora Emporium, Red Apple"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Discovery Inn, Christian Vineyard, Aurora Emporium, Red Apple</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: The Aurora Emporium Art Gallery is one of several businesses that submitted letters to city hall decrying the territory&#x27;s intent to turn the neighbouring 4709 Franklin Ave. into a temporary shelter until the fall of 2024.
