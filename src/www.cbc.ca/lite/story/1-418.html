Ether fell 10 per cent while XRP was down a similar amount.</p><p>&quot;There&#x27;s a degree of panic in the air,&quot; said Joseph Edwards, head of research at cryptocurrency broker Enigma Securities in London.</p><p>Promoters of cryptocurrencies say they allow anonymity and flexibility, but Chinese regulators worry they might weaken the ruling Communist Party&#x27;s control over the financial system and say they might help to conceal criminal activity.</p><p>The People&#x27;s Bank of China is developing an electronic version of the country&#x27;s yuan for cashless transactions that can be tracked and controlled by Beijing.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6076611">World&#x27;s central banks launch new campaign against cryptocurrencies</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6179508">Teetering property developer Evergrande sparks fears instability will spread through China&#x27;s economy</a></li></ul></p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
