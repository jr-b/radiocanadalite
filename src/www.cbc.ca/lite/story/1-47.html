Civil Liberties Association is preparing to face the RCMP commissioner&#x27;s office in court over what they call &quot;extreme delays&quot; in responding to public complaints about police misconduct.</p><p>A lawsuit filed by the association alleges the commissioner&#x27;s office sits on public complaints for years at a time, ultimately leading to inadequate police accountability and oversight.</p><p>&quot;This is a serious systemic problem with the RCMP,&quot; said Paul Champ, legal counsel for the BCCLA based in Ottawa. &quot;There are many Canadians who wait two, three, four and five years and longer for the RCMP commissioner to release public complaint reports.&quot;</p><p>The lawsuit says it&#x27;s the duty of the commissioner to review and respond to public complaints in a reasonable period of time.

CBC News has reached out to the RCMP for comment.</p><h2>Report delays</h2><p>The lawsuit stems from a February 2014 complaint from the BCCLA alleging officers spied on Indigenous and environmental groups who were opposed to the now-defunct Northern Gateway pipeline proposal, and who attended National Energy Board meetings in 2012 and 2013.</p><p>The complaint was filed with the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission (CRCC), an RCMP watchdog that reviews complaints about police conduct.</p><p>Before final CRCC reports are released, the RCMP must respond to the commission&#x27;s findings and outline whether or not actions will be taken.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5841752">Watchdog finds RCMP&#x27;s policing of anti-pipeline protesters reasonable — but sees gaps in surveillance policies</a></li></ul></p><p>The BCCLA lawsuit alleges the RCMP commissioner&#x27;s office dragged its heels when responding to the Northern Gateway complaint and ultimately delayed the CRCC by several years. The final report <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5841752">was only released in December 2020</a> — seven years after the initial complaint was filed and more than three years after CRCC findings were submitted to the RCMP commissioner.</p><p>The BCCLA argues that the legal requirement for a response &quot;as soon as feasible&quot; should mean a matter of months, not years.</p><p>According to court documents, there are 106 interim reports that have been awaiting a response from the RCMP commissioner for more than one year. The BCCLA says the delays have undermined the public&#x27;s confidence in the complaints process.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6168210">Fairy Creek protest on Vancouver Island now considered largest act of civil disobedience in Canadian history</a></li></ul></p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s a completely broken system.
