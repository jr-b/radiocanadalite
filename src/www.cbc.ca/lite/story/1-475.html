CBC News calculated infection rates based on cumulative cases reported and vaccination rates based on the total number of prisoners who had received one dose of the vaccine. Figures only represent adult prisoners. Because the vast majority of prisons and jails have only offered a first dose, we compared carceral figures with <a href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/"><u>the total percentage of Canadians who had received at least one dose during the week of May 31, 2021</u><img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a>.</p>   <p><strong>Caveats and data gaps:</strong> Ontario&#x27;s Ministry of the Solicitor General initially refused to provide a breakdown of vaccinated inmates per facility as &quot;public health units [are] the leads on this [vaccination rollout]&quot; and told CBC News it should &quot;follow up with public health units on the number of vaccines administered to provincial inmates.&quot; CBC News did ask the 20 regional health units with a correctional facility in their jurisdiction when they held vaccination clinics and how many prisoners were vaccinated. Fifteen provided detailed figures and five health regions refused to disclose, saying they did not compile those statistics or referring CBC back to the Ministry of the Solicitor General. The missing figures were eventually provided by the government. The total of 3,035 vaccinated prisoners used in this story reflect our best efforts to compile accurate data at this time. </p>   <p>Nova Scotia&#x27;s Justice Department refused to provide CBC News with any statistics related to vaccination, stating that &quot;vaccination is personal health information. That is not something the department would have or share.&quot; </p>   <p>The New Brunswick Department of Health could not provide CBC News with an exact number of vaccinated inmates, stating that &quot;vaccination was offered for about 460 offenders and to staff. A total of 389 doses were administered during these clinics.&quot; </p>   <p>The Nunavut government could only provide CBC News with a cumulative number of doses administered, which included first and second doses in one total and could not be compared with other provinces. </p>   <p><strong>Research and data analysis: Valérie Ouellet, senior data journalist, CBC News</strong></p>  </div><p> </p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
