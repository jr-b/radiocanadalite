Data from the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit (WECHU) notes there were 346 opioid-related emergency department visits. </p><p>Between January and March that year, there were 16 opioid-related deaths. </p><p>According to preliminary data from Public Health Ontario, the first three months of 2021 saw nine deaths related to opioid overdoses. But this year, Windsor-Essex issued more overdose alerts than ever before — 11, as of mid-September.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6179430">Alert issued after Windsor-Essex sees 10 opioid overdoses in a week</a></li></ul></p><p>The Downtown Mission says the use of naloxone — a drug that reverses an opioid overdose — has saved lives. Staff  reversed 88 opioid overdoses in 2020. </p><p>While Mooney said it&#x27;s good there&#x27;s a drug that can save people, he said it&#x27;s also &quot;made it even easier&quot; for people to brush aside the consequences of an overdose. </p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | People gathered outside downtown mission"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | People gathered outside downtown mission</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: In Windsor-Essex, 63 people died last year from opioid overdoses.
