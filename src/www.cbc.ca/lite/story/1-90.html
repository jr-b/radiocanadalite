Surely it&#x27;s too early for a story about the holidays.</p><p>But the holidays are where Surrey-based children&#x27;s author and illustrator Paola Opal&#x27;s mind is: a critical time for sales of her series of small, brightly coloured board books for very young children.</p><p>&quot;These books make great little gifts for stocking stuffers,&quot; Opal said. </p><p>But this year, her books could be kept off shelves by supply chain issues impacting the publishing landscape in B.C. and beyond.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Paola Opal"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Paola Opal</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Paola Opal said if her new books don&#x27;t ship in time for the holidays, it could mean thousands of dollars in lost sales.  (Submitted by Paola Opal)</p></div></div></p><p>Opal was expecting to have her latest books in stores by October but her publisher is telling her they may not arrive until 2022, missing the holidays entirely.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s a whole year of missed sales, really. And it&#x27;s really sad,&quot; Opal said.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s hard to make a living as an author and so when you take a few thousand dollars out of an author&#x27;s annual pay, that&#x27;s very significant.&quot;</p><p>Many in B.C.&#x27;s publishing world are concerned about disruptions in their supply chain, saying it could lead to lost sales and book-buying consumers having fewer choices or long waits for specific books.</p><h2>&#x27;A lot of uncertainty&#x27;</h2><p>Heidi Waechtler, executive director of the Association of Book Publishers of British Columbia, said in B.C. and beyond, publishers are watching carefully.</p><p>&quot;I think they&#x27;re all worried,&quot; Waechtler said. &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of uncertainty.&quot;</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6188919">Some gasoline stations in U.K. run out of fuel as pandemic supply chain crisis deepens</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6177016">Lumber crash leads to &#x27;blowout&#x27; sales as prices crater</a></li></ul></p><p>Smaller publishers could be hurt the most, she said. With fewer staff they will be challenged to navigate the situation.<strong> </strong>They also tend to prioritize emerging or lesser-known authors who have less sales data, which makes it difficult to predict demand.</p><p>&quot;They have to look at upcoming authors and make some difficult decisions about which ones to prioritize,&quot; Waechtler said. &quot;It might mean lost sales.&quot;</p><p>Writers who seem especially vulnerable are those with books printed overseas. Most full-colour books are printed overseas, so many children&#x27;s book writers are worried.</p><p>&quot;If they can&#x27;t get the new releases in [store] ... that&#x27;s going to have a knock-on effect to royalties,&quot; said K. A. Wiggins, president of the Children&#x27;s Writers and Illustrators of B.C.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | K.A. Wiggins"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | K.A. Wiggins</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: K.A. Wiggins said the works of many childrens&#x27; authors, especially those writing for very young children, don&#x27;t translate to e-book very well which makes having physical books available for purchase extremely important for sales.  (K.A. Wiggins)</p></div></div></p><p>&quot;We&#x27;re absolutely going to see authors, illustrators stepping back from trying to publish ... They&#x27;re getting discouraged.&quot;</p><p>Not all writers will be affected, said Barb Drozdowich, a board member with the Federation of B.C. Writers. </p><p>E-book authors will be better insulated, she said, compared to those who produce children&#x27;s books, coffee table books and other types of books that are generally consumed as a physical product. </p><h2>Printers swamped, paper scarce</h2><p>When a book wins or is short-listed for a literary award, or when the author appears in the media, or even when a celebrity highlights a book on social media, the demand for that book will increase and publishers usually print more.</p><p>Doug Climie, vice-president of sales and marketing for Burnaby-based Hemlock Printers, says printers are struggling to keep up with on-the-fly demand across the industry.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Doug Climie"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Doug Climie</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Doug Climie said any publishers who haven&#x27;t put their holiday orders in for printing likely won&#x27;t have them completed by Christmas.

Some mills formerly making book paper have shuttered in recent years or switched to making cardboard packaging for e-commerce sellers like Amazon.</p><p>The price on the paper that is available has increased several times since the start of the pandemic.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s absolutely unprecedented ... that we&#x27;ve had as short of supply, as well as significant price increases at the same time,&quot; said Chad Friesen, CEO of Friesens, a book printer in southern Manitoba.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Hemlock Printers"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Hemlock Printers</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: An employee at Hemlock Printers at one of the press machines. Climie says while the printing business has seen challenges in the past, he hasn&#x27;t seen so many come together for so long in his years in the field.  (Tristan Le Rudulier/CBC)</p></div></div></p><p>Even recycled paper is harder to come by, said Ian Larouche, marketing director of Quebec-based Marquis Books.</p><p>&quot;All the offices are closed,&quot; said Larouche. &quot;Everybody is working from home so they don&#x27;t get a lot of paper to recycle.&quot;</p><p>Over the years, some printers in North America have shut down or moved overseas, reducing capacity in North America.</p><p>Some North American printers are also facing a labour shortage with the pandemic hampering foreign worker recruitment.</p><h2>Shops scrambling</h2><p>Kelly McKinnon, co-owner of Vancouver bookstore Kidsboooks, says there will be no shortage of books stocked this holiday season but specific books may be harder to find. </p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Kidsbooks"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Kidsbooks</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: An example of a hot item at Kidsbooks, McKinnon said, are manga — Japanese comic books or graphic novels. McKinnon said it can take months to get new stocked shipped in.  (Tristan Le Rudulier/CBC)</p></div></div></p><p>McKinnon and other retailers always want the right books on the shelves but said 2021 has been &quot;exponentially harder&quot; because retailers have less sales data and must order books earlier in larger numbers.</p><p>&quot;I need a crystal ball,&quot; McKinnon said. &quot;We&#x27;re used to supplying the market quite quickly.&quot;</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6160851">COVID-19 created lots of supply chain problems — and they&#x27;re nowhere close to being solved</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6156397">Why did you cross the road?

The good news, he said, is more mills may reopen and return to producing book paper.</p><p>Another solution some are calling for is a return to more printing done in Canada.</p><p>&quot;That&#x27;s something I think we want to figure out,&quot; said Waechtler.</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
