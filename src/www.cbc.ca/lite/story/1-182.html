It goes on to provide details of two vaccination clinics being held at C.W. Wiebe Medical Centre in Winkler on Oct. 7 and 15, where Garden Valley students can go to get immunized.</p><p>Dr. Joss Reimer, medical lead of Manitoba&#x27;s vaccine task force, confirmed on Monday that the division will not host in-school vaccine clinics.</p><p>&quot;Certainly there are some schools and school divisions that might delay and in the end may choose not to hold COVID clinics, but we are always open to re-evaluating and reassessing,&quot; Reimer said. &quot;There&#x27;s no necessary end date to when they could potentially participate.&quot;</p><p>The news comes as the beginning of Manitoba&#x27;s fourth wave continues to gain momentum, driven largely by a disproportionate number of cases from the Southern Health region.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6184843">Southern Manitoba doctor hopes outreach funds help health-care workers better connect with the unvaccinated</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6189599">Tensions mount at Manitoba immunization sites as vaccine mandates loom, workers say</a></li></ul></p><h2>Significant transmission</h2><p>Manitoba Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Brent Roussin said on Monday there is <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6191164">significant spread happening in the south, with the rate of infection more than double that of the provincial average.</a></p><p>Southern Health also makes up about half of new COVID-19 cases, despite being home to just over 15 per cent of the provincial population, said Roussin.</p><p>He said more than half of the people from Southern Health who have been admitted to intensive care units lately have only received their first COVID-19 test after they presented at hospital with symptoms.</p><p>Roussin said this suggests some of those people had likely been out in the community spreading the virus before getting sick enough to need hospitalization.</p><p>The Winkler health district holds the second-lowest vaccination rate in the province at 41.3 per cent as of Monday, followed by the neighbouring health district of Stanley at 24 per cent.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6182736">Police chief calls for end to &#x27;anger and resentment&#x27; as Winkler roils with hostility to pandemic rules</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6186024">Healing vaccination divisions &#x27;might be a generation in the making,&#x27; Winkler residents fear</a></li></ul></p><p>Driedger said some from outside southern communities might hear about Garden Valley and question why the division wouldn&#x27;t take advantage of access to in-school vaccinations.</p><p>&quot;I suspect it&#x27;s a feeling of just having people coming and telling them what to do and how to behave and how to be. It&#x27;s not something that&#x27;s sitting well,&quot; said Driedger.</p><p>&quot;At the same time, I think we all have to try to work collectively because our individual choices and our individual rights have an impact on other people around us.&quot;</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
