They&#x27;re just sick of it all, and they said, &#x27;You know, what the main thing is, we just want to be married.&#x27;&quot;</p><p>Clemens has seen an unprecedented increase in couples asking for bookings mere weeks in advance.

Her phone is ringing off the hook these days.</p><p>Often couples who live away from Nova Scotia are rushing to come home to get hitched before restrictions can tighten again. </p><p>&quot;They&#x27;re literally calling me two weeks before they arrive here,&quot; Hodder said. &quot;They&#x27;re not even on the island yet and they&#x27;re calling me going, &#x27;What are the chances I can get, like, this, this, this and this for this date?&#x27;&quot;</p><p>Hodder said everyone always buys flowers but they might need to adjust their expectations. The unusually busy season has put pressure on a market that&#x27;s already struggled throughout the pandemic.</p><p>&quot;The prediction was we weren&#x27;t going to have a wedding season this year so they planted about half the amount of flowers they usually do.</p><p>&quot;So what&#x27;s happening now is we&#x27;re going into a full crazy wedding season where everybody wants almost all the same things and these poor nurseries can&#x27;t keep up.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Katie Hodder"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Katie Hodder</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Katie Hodder owns Family Heirblooms in Membertou.

Clemens is expecting an even busier year in 2022, possibly spilling over into 2023. </p><p>&quot;A lot of your vendors may be booked next year.… I would suggest maybe looking at weekdays for weddings because we&#x27;re available … and you&#x27;re going to get more of what you want.&quot;</p><p>Hodder offered some advice for people booking into 2022 and 2023. She said to book any professional who needs to be there for the entire day as soon as possible.</p><p>&quot;Find a date, get your venue booked now, call your caterer, call your DJ, get literally everyone who is booked for the day. Those are the people who are hard to get.&quot;</p><p><strong>MORE TOP STORIES </strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6190201">&#x27;Go big or go home&#x27;: Volunteers needed to put together 300,000 COVID testing kits</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6190191">Dalhousie condemns &#x27;reckless behaviour&#x27; of students after street parties near campus</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6188474">Alberta man unites with long lost half-siblings in Nova Scotia after surprise DNA test</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6189860">&#x27;Relax, we are double vaxxed&#x27;: Hundreds of Dalhousie students attend street party</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6189802">Halifax rally pushes for guaranteed basic income</a></li></ul></p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
