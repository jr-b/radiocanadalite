And QR codes would just be another conduit to that.&quot;</p><p>She said some restaurants are using QR codes to gather contact tracing information as well as for menus.</p><p>With the drive to reduce contact with surfaces and each other, QR codes have increased in popularity during the pandemic, said Stevens, particularly in China, where their use increased six per cent between 2019 and 2020.</p><p>Stevens notes that last month <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6148020"><u>a benevolent hacking group already alerted the public that it had been able to hack the Quebec government&#x27;s new vaccine passport system</u></a>, which led to 300,000 QR codes being exposed.
