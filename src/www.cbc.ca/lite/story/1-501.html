But the recent increase in digital financial transactions has created a fraudster&#x27;s paradise, according to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, a joint effort by the Ontario Provincial Police, the RCMP and the Competition Bureau. </p><p>Senior RCMP intelligence analyst and spokesperson Jeff Thomson says last year fraudsters made off with nearly 1,800 e-transfers totalling almost $3 million in reported losses — up more than $400,000 from 2019. Thomson says those reports just represent the tip of the iceberg. </p><p>&quot;With the pandemic, you have an increased pool of victims — more people at home looking to acquire day-to-day products and services that they can&#x27;t otherwise go out and get,&quot; said Thomson. &quot;It&#x27;s a ripe environment.

But when she clicked on that e-transfer three weeks later — within the 30-day limit to accept it — she got a notification saying it had already been deposited.</p><p>&quot;I was like, &#x27;Did I deposit it previously and just not remember?&#x27; But I went through my transaction history and there was no deposit,&quot; she said. &quot;So I thought, &#x27;That&#x27;s really strange. Maybe it&#x27;s just a glitch.&#x27;&quot;</p><p>She soon learned it was no glitch. Her client&#x27;s financial institution — Servus Credit Union in Edmonton — said there must have been an email hack and the money had been redirected to someone else&#x27;s account at another bank. </p><p>She was out of luck. Lok says a Servus customer service rep told her that the credit union has no responsibility when e-transfers get hacked. That&#x27;s because Interac e-transfers involve email — and financial institutions have no control over people&#x27;s email security.</p><p>In a phone call with Servus, Lok says the service rep likened using e-transfer to a customer taking the money out of a financial institution, walking down the street and then getting robbed — an analogy that riles her.</p><p>&quot;We&#x27;re not out on a street just flashing cash around and then getting mugged,&quot; said Lok. &quot;It&#x27;s a banking service that&#x27;s tied to their company … It doesn&#x27;t say that this is not secure.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Servus Credit Union"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Servus Credit Union</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Lok says a customer service rep at this Servus Credit Union branch blamed her for &#x27;letting the funds linger&#x27; when she didn’t deposit an e-transfer right away.

The co-founder of Knowledgeflow Cybersafety Foundation, a non-profit aimed at educating the public about cybercrime, says she&#x27;s seen an increase in e-transfer issues since the pandemic — likely because so many people are making payments online instead of using cash.</p><p>&quot;For some people it&#x27;s a lot of money that they&#x27;ve lost, and that&#x27;s a big deal,&quot; she said. &quot;This is … a real problem and it&#x27;s really hard to solve.&quot;</p><p>Backman says the banks could play a much bigger role in preventing e-transfer issues for customers, without too much effort.</p><p>&quot;There could be more information around things that people can do to protect themselves when they go on those [e-transfer] pages,&quot; says Backman. </p><p>Backman argues, though, that it&#x27;s a two-way street — customers need to do their part to protect their money.</p><p><em><strong>WATCH | The trouble with e-transfers amid pandemic spike:</strong></em></p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Media Video | The trouble with e-transfers amid pandemic spike | Go Public"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Media Video | The trouble with e-transfers amid pandemic spike | Go Public</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: As more Canadians transferred money electronically during the pandemic, one business owner found out the hard way that some financial institutions say they won&#x27;t reimburse e-transfers that are stolen. </p></div></div></p><p>Since fraudsters hack into the sender or recipient&#x27;s email to steal an e-transfer, Backman urges people to change their email passwords frequently. </p><p>E-transfers also require a security question, so make it a strong one, says Backman, not one that a fraudster could easily guess.</p><p>Richard Garner of Toronto admits the security question he asked when he sent his personal trainer an e-transfer in November wasn&#x27;t &quot;Fort Knox level&quot; but says that&#x27;s not the point.</p><p>&quot;There might be some people who go, &#x27;Oh, it&#x27;s too bad … you should have been smarter,&#x27;&quot; he says.</p><p>&quot;The real matter — that shouldn&#x27;t be lost on anybody — is that the banks knew for a long time that e-transfer fraud was happening.
