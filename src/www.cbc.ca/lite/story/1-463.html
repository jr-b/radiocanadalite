The Crown&#x27;s obligations under treaty, as established in the original agreements with our ancestors, will remain, &quot;as long as the sun shines, the grass grows and the rivers flow.&quot;</p><p>They do not remain, &quot;until you start voting.&quot; </p><p>It is our own relationships with the Creator and the land that will determine whether we are living in a way that honours what our ancestors fought to protect. To this day, we maintain that we have never ceded nor surrendered our land and retain our sovereignty through our Inherent and treaty rights. </p><p>Many Indigenous peoples still believe that voting will hinder our sovereignty and assimilate us as citizens of Canada.<br/> If this is true and I suddenly become assimilated through the eyes of some that are more &quot;Indigenous&quot; than me, so be it. </p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6150558">Canada&#x27;s justice system treats Indigenous peoples as inherently criminal.

This is why I never wanted to vote in Canada&#x27;s elections in the past. </p><p>But after years working with both First Nations bands and the Canadian government, I now realize that Indigenous peoples still have a long way to go before we form that real government of our own. </p><p>I will spend the rest of my life trying to make our own government a reality, while defending our Inherent and treaty rights. However, while we rebuild what is left of our nationhood, our children are suffering every day from chronic underfunding, systemic racism and colonial policy. </p><ul>   <li><strong>Have an election question for CBC News?
