The bottle was covered in seaweed and barnacles, but she could see something inside.</p><p>&quot;I put it in my pocket, and took it home,&quot; said the 52-year-old. </p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Amanda Tidmarsh message bottle CHECK NOTES"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Amanda Tidmarsh message bottle CHECK NOTES</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: The note included a description of where the bottle had been thrown in the ocean.

The letter was signed off by a snow crab fisherman named Craig Drover in Newfoundland. </p><p>&quot;Unbelievable, isn&#x27;t it? How it reached without getting smashed or lodged in rocks.
