(Submitted by Mike Westwick)</p></div></div></div><div><p>A mother bear, given the name Copper because she had been spending time behind the Copperhouse restaurant in Yellowknife with her two cubs, has been safely relocated, according to wildlife officials.</p><p>Mike Westwick, a spokesperson for the N.W.T.&#x27;s Department of Environment and Natural Resources (ENR), told CBC News that a wildlife veterinarian, four ENR officers and two biologists headed to the business shortly before 7 p.m. Friday to capture the trio.</p><p>&quot;In this case, we were dealing with a populated area — the bears were naturally quite skittish by all the action going on — and a very protective mom, of course,&quot; Westwick explained.</p><p>The family was first spotted on Thursday near the airport, where ENR said one of the animals had aggressively charged an individual.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6189398">Family of bears spotted getting into Yellowknife restaurant garbage</a></li></ul></p><p>Adding to the challenge of capturing the bears near the restaurant, said Westwick, was the fact that one of cubs had climbed up a tree.</p><p>&quot;Naturally, it&#x27;s a pretty scary situation — Mom had been tranquilized already and the cub was looking for some safety,&quot; he said.</p><p>However, wildlife officers are able to handle &quot;hairy situations when it comes to wildlife interactions,&quot; said Westwick. </p><p>&quot;Our staff were gently shaking the tree and … [were] able to get the cub to come down.

The number to report wildlife emergencies or sightings in Yellowknife is 867-873-7181.</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
