And when I sent in my application, they already had a prior encounter with my work, so I&#x27;m assuming it wasn&#x27;t a no-brainer.&quot;</p><p>The opportunity comes at a good time, he said, because it has been difficult working as a photographer through the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>&quot;The access to my studio was really limited, and even people were not feeling very safe by coming into a studio or even being around other people in general. So you can&#x27;t meet, the bookings get very slow … there was no travel that was allowed or gathering.

The group is planning an in-person event in the coming months.
