Counting only those who are currently eligible, 77.47 per cent have received both doses and 84.60 per cent have received one dose.</p><p>As more provinces introduce proof-of-vaccination certificates, there have been more protests against public health restrictions and vaccine mandates across Canada.</p><p>Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba and B.C. have all announced their own versions of a vaccine mandate, and that has some people seeking exemptions.

She said they&#x27;ve received very little push back.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6168546">Hospital protests pushing already exhausted staff to the brink, says Vancouver doctor</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6161606">Vaccine passports are a &#x27;huge ethical minefield,&#x27; says bioethicist </a></li></ul></p><h2>Medical exemptions</h2><p>In Ontario, there are two reasons for a medical exemption from the vaccine. The first is for anyone who suffered a severe allergy or anaphylactic reaction to a prior dose of the vaccine, which has been confirmed by an allergist or immunologist.</p><p>The other possible exemption is the diagnosis of myocarditis, which is inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis, which is inflammation of the sac around the heart muscle, after receiving a dose of a mRNA vaccine. </p><p>Dr. Mariam Hanna has been hearing from people looking for a medical exemption since provinces have announced vaccine mandates. </p><p>&quot;A lot more patients are asking about, &#x27;I had this type of reaction after my first dose. Does this merit an exemption or am I safe to get the second dose?&#x27;&quot; said Hanna, the Ontario Medical Association&#x27;s Chair for Allergy and Clinical Immunology.</p><p>She says her response comes down to distinguishing between a serious allergic reaction and an expected side effect to the vaccine.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/SWISS-VACCINATION"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/SWISS-VACCINATION</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Dr. Mariam Hanna says there are only 2 categories of people who can get a medical exemption from COVID-19 vaccines in Ontario.

And we hardly ever give a true medical exemption because of a reaction that has occurred,&quot; said Hanna. </p><p>But she says it&#x27;s very important to have a conversation with people about the vaccine and its potential side effects. </p><p>&quot;We want to arm patients with as much information as possible as to what the safety is about this vaccine,&quot; said Hanna. </p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6151550">Toronto restaurateur says anti-vaccine protesters are harassing her patrons and staff </a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6019582">Health officials should consider a different approach to address vaccine hesitancy, say experts</a></li></ul></p><h2>Having conversations</h2><p>Maxwell Smith, a bioethicist and an assistant professor at Western University in London, Ont., says it gets more complicated when someone says getting the vaccine is against their conscious, because it&#x27;s important not to belittle people&#x27;s sincerely held beliefs.</p><p>But he says giving an exemption to everyone who asks isn&#x27;t the answer either.</p><p>&quot;Exemptions to vaccine mandates and passports tend to simply defeat their purpose.

(Hassene Dridi/Reuters)</p></div></div></p><p>Like Hanna and Pauls, Smith believes it&#x27;s essential to have conversations with people who don&#x27;t want to get the vaccine. He says it&#x27;s going to be a tough battle, but it&#x27;s important. </p><p>&quot;Some populations have a history of marginalization and oppression and have good reason to be distrustful of governments and medical establishments,&quot; said Smith.</p><p>&quot;If we don&#x27;t want to entrench that mistrust even further, having these conversations is the right move to get them on board and at least see how we can work collectively to end this pandemic.&quot;</p><hr/><p><em>Written by Philip Drost.
