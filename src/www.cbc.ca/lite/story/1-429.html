Sorry for the inconvenience caused,&quot; she said.</p><p>Meng spent her time in Canada under house arrest at her multimillion-dollar home in Vancouver, in stark contrast to Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who endured poor conditions in detention and whose legal processes were criticized by Canadian officials.

But as long as you respect international treaties, international obligations and you don&#x27;t engage in bullying tactics,&quot; he said.</p><p>Ong said she believes the relationship with China has been permanently damaged. She said public opinion in Canada has turned decisively against China and a return to normal would be &quot;very hard&quot; to execute.</p><p>&quot;I don&#x27;t think Canada-China relations could actually be repaired.
