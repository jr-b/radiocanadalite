She said their relationship was initially professional, but became friendlier over time, as he showed an interest in her personal life and career. </p><p>On Jan. 6, 2004, she went to his house to discuss a career move she was considering.</p><p>&quot;That came to be, you know, the night I sat down and, you know, accepted three small blue pills, which I thought were a herbal remedy from Cosby,&quot; she said. </p><p>&quot;And I ended up on the couch that night, unconscious, in and out of consciousness, with the most disturbing things happening to me.&quot;</p><p>She awoke the next day overcome with &quot;shame and disgust,&quot; and feeling like &quot;a completely different person,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;I think overnight I had just lost my trust, lost my faith in people and, you know, had to deal with the aftermath immediately of what happened to me.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Bill Cosby Through the Years"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Bill Cosby Through the Years</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Bill Cosby leaves the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pa., during the 2017 trial.  (Matt Rourke/Associated Press)</p></div></div></p><p>Constand said it took months for her to process what had happened, eventually getting to the point where she could tell her mother. </p><p>She said her mother called Cosby to question him about what had happened that night — a call that Constand ended up joining.</p><p>&quot;Every bit of what he did to me on that couch rolled off my tongue, and I just confronted him about everything he had done — and my mom just listened,&quot; he said. </p><p>&quot;For me, that was a moment where I could at least get it off my chest.&quot; </p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | BOOK COVER: The Moment by Andrea Constand"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | BOOK COVER: The Moment by Andrea Constand</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">  (Viking)</p></div></div></p><h2>#MeToo stories brought solidarity</h2><p>Constand originally reported Cosby to police in 2005. After former Montgomery County District Attorney <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bill-cosby-bruce-castor-former-district-attorney-stands-by-decision-not-to-prosecute/">Bruce Castor publicly declined to charge Cosby<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a>, she pursued a civil case, during which Cosby acknowledged that he had given drugs to women before sexual encounters. Constand eventually settled the civil case for $3.38 million US, and was bound by a non-disclosure agreement (NDA).</p><p>After the civil case, Constand knew Cosby faced accusations from other women, but was now bound by an NDA that left her with a renewed pain, but also feeling less alone, she said.</p><p>&quot;It gave me hope that at some point we could get together and try to heal together.&quot;</p><p>She got that opportunity in the 2017 trial, which ended in a hung jury, and the retrial the following year. The trials coincided with a groundswell of survivors speaking out about sexual assault, as part of the #MeToo movement.</p><p>&quot;[#MeToo] brought a new awareness and a new consciousness&quot; that helped to educate people on how survivors feel, and why many stayed silent for so long, she said. </p><p>&quot;Storytelling is very, very powerful, and I think we need to not be afraid to tell our stories. We&#x27;ve come too far.&quot;</p><p>When evidence from the civil suit was unsealed in 2015, Castor&#x27;s successor, district attorney Kevin Steele, brought charges against Cosby. But three years after he was convicted, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said Steele was obligated to stand by Castor&#x27;s statement that Cosby would not be charged. </p><p>The court said that overturning the conviction, and barring any further prosecution, &quot;is the only remedy that comports with society&#x27;s reasonable expectations of its elected prosecutors and our criminal justice system.&quot;</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.4637129">Cosby accuser credits Andrea Constand&#x27;s perseverance, #MeToo for guilty verdict</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6087040">Bill Cosby&#x27;s sexual assault case did &#x27;change the tide,&#x27;  even though conviction overturned: lawyer</a></li></ul></p><p>In the book, Constand writes that she doesn&#x27;t wish suffering on Cosby.</p><p>&quot;I really realized I can&#x27;t continue to be in his world,&quot; she told Galloway.</p><p>&quot;I just have to continue to move forward, to be an inspiration to others, to help others,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;This is what healing looks like.
