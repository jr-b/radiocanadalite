(CBC)</p></div></div></p><p>Since then, regional poison centres across the country have reported a spike in unintentional poisonings of children and teens involving edibles — though it is unclear how many of those cases involved illicit, lookalike packages. Data was not available from every province and territory.</p><p>Such poisonings roughly doubled in B.C., Nova Scotia and Quebec between 2019 and 2020. B.C. saw almost 100 cases in 2020. Ontario, Manitoba and Nunavut, which report their poisonings together, reported 166.</p><p>No fatal poisonings of children or youth involving just cannabis have been reported to Health Canada since legalization in 2018.</p><p>After treating the toddler, the first thing Pegg did was contact Health Canada, to ask how to report the poisoning — but no one got back to her.</p><p>&quot;I followed their reporting guidelines, I followed up by phone … [but] had no response until you [Go Public] contacted them.&quot;</p><p>Pegg finally heard back in January, more than two months after she reported the incident.</p><p><strong><em>WATCH | Go Public explores the prevalence of pot edibles that look candy:</em></strong></p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Media Video | Illegal pot edibles that look like candy are poisoning children | Go Public"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Media Video | Illegal pot edibles that look like candy are poisoning children | Go Public</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Go Public found hundreds of websites selling illicit pot-laced edibles with packages designed to look like all types of candy and chocolate bars — and there have been serious consequences. </p></div></div></p><p>Health Canada tells Go Public that Pegg&#x27;s email was sent to a &quot;generic&quot; email account which gets a lot of messages and there was a &quot;delay in processing the information.&quot;</p><p>Health Canada also said, via email, that after seeing an increase in such reports, it <a href="https://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2020/73669a-eng.php">issued an advisory<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> in August about accidental ingestion of illegal edible cannabis products by children and launched &quot;extensive public education and advertising campaigns … to encourage adults to store all cannabis securely.&quot;</p><p>Statistics Canada says an estimated 42 per cent of cannabis users — 743,800 Canadians who responded to the survey — got pot from illegal sources in 2019.</p><h2>&#x27;Whack-a-mole&#x27;</h2><p>In its January email to Pegg, Canada Health said she should contact the RCMP or her local police department.</p><p>But it&#x27;s not quite that simple, according to the co-chair of the drug advisory committee at the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police.</p><p>Mike Serr says there are at least 1,100 illegal sites operating just in Canada, and while police have had success shutting some down, the problem is bigger than they can handle.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | New Cannabis Products 20200103"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | New Cannabis Products 20200103</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: These cannabis edibles, displayed at the Ontario Cannabis Store in Toronto, comply with the federal Cannabis Act rules requiring plain packaging and standard warning labels  (Tijana Martin/The Canadian Press)</p></div></div></p><p>&quot;I wish I had a better term, but really whack-a-mole describes it quite well.

In many cases, it&#x27;s hard to tell the difference between legal and illegal sites, says Fraser. Adding to that confusion, she says, are the different rules in different provinces about how pot is sold online.</p><p>Ontario, for example, has one legal, provincially run cannabis website that can sell and ship and private licensed retailers that can sell online for in-store pickup. Saskatchewan and Manitoba allow private, licensed retailers to sell and ship online.</p><p>&quot;So, in some cases,&quot; says Fraser, &quot;it becomes very tricky for the public to understand what is a licensed retailer and what is not.&quot;</p><p>Possessing cannabis purchased from illicit websites is also a crime.</p><p>Public Safety Canada says it has a plan that will crack down on the thriving, illicit market. That &quot;action plan&quot; was announced last March, but hasn&#x27;t been implemented.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | An illegal cannabis website"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | An illegal cannabis website</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: This website above is one of many that sell lookalike pot candy.
