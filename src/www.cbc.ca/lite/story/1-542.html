First, four students made formal complaints saying they were sexually assaulted on campus. Then, reports began circulating on social media alleging that dozens of women were drugged and some sexually assaulted inside a school residence last Friday night. No formal complaints have been made in that case, and London Police are investigating. Rebekah Rodrigues is a news editor with the university’s student newspaper, the Western Gazette, and a fourth-year student at Western. She describes the climate on campus and what she sees as a will among students to come together for change. </p></div></div></p><h2>Sex education needed from kindergarten: expert</h2><p>Farrah Khan, manager of Consent Comes First at Ryerson University&#x27;s Office of Sexual Violence Support and Education, said efforts to address &quot;rape culture&quot; on campuses must be taken farther.</p><p>But those tasked with addressing sexual violence on campuses are often overstretched and poorly supported, she said.</p><p>&quot;Oftentimes, it&#x27;s one person that&#x27;s mandated to do the support and education for [a] whole campus community, and that, one, leads to a lot of burnout for that person, but also means that they can&#x27;t give the support and resources that students need when they are themselves so stretched.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Thousands of students staged a walkout at Western University in support of survivors of sexual violence on Sept. 17, 2021."><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Thousands of students staged a walkout at Western University in support of survivors of sexual violence on Sept. 17, 2021.</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Many students say they now feel unsafe on campus, according to Rebekah Rodrigues, a journalist for the school&#x27;s student newspaper.
