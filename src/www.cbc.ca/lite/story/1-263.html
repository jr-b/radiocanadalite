(Paul Withers/CBC)</p></div></div></p><p>The key findings are that locally-created ozone has decreased, and so has the amount of ozone pollutants blown into Nova Scotia from the northeastern United States. The latter finding is especially notable because ozone can be transported long distances and Nova Scotia is considered at the tailpipe of North America.</p><p>The study found this &quot;transported&quot; pollution now makes up a greater proportion of the surface ozone, accounting for 45 to 63 per cent of ozone levels in Halifax.</p><p>Mitchell attributes the overall decrease in ozone levels to regulations that cut emissions from sources like power generation and vehicle exhaust.</p><h2>What Nova Scotia Power is doing</h2><p>Nova Scotia Power has reduced its nitrous oxide emissions by 58 per cent since 2005, said spokesperson Jacqueline Foster in a statement. She said the utility has installed low nitrous oxide emissions systems on some of its thermal generating stations. Foster said further reductions will be seen as the utility weans itself off coal by 2030.</p><p>The study found ozone levels in the Halifax area spike during morning rush hour and dissipate.</p><p>Mitchell said individuals can help help reduce the amount of locally-produced ozone.</p><p>&quot;We can drive less cars, we can shop more locally, so less goods are being transported in the city from elsewhere and that will improve our air quality,&quot; she said.</p><h2>More research being carried out</h2><p>In the last five years of the study period, there was a reduction in the rate of the ozone decrease. Mitchell does not know why, saying it could be population growth or more people driving.</p><p>She said 70 per cent of the pollutants from the United States pass over Nova Scotia and never drop to the surface. Why that&#x27;s the case is being researched.</p><p>&quot;We really want to be able to better predict these events of high ozone so that we can warn vulnerable populations,&quot; said Mitchell.</p><p>&quot;And to do that, we have to better understand when these transport events are happening and what is bringing that pollution from up above down to the surface.&quot;</p><p><strong>MORE TOP STORIES</strong> <ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6190812">N.S. reports one new death, 83 new cases of COVID-19 over the weekend</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6191175">Inquiry examining N.S. mass shootings holds open houses</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6191090">Search for solutions begins after huge Dal student party overwhelms neighbourhood</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6191157">Alleged drunk driver crashes into home, forcing couple out</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6191112">Province announces new money to repair gravel roads, ice rinks in Nova Scotia</a></li></ul></p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
