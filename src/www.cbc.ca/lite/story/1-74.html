Proof of vaccination will be needed for admittance to places such as restaurants and health-care facilities as well as to private events, including wedding and funeral receptions.</p><p>But wedding ceremonies — as opposed to receptions — are exempt.</p><p>&quot;If we have a ceremony and reception in the same place, the [unvaccinated] guests are allowed to attend the ceremony but they&#x27;re not allowed to attend the reception.
