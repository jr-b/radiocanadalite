But many travellers are heading to warmer pastures anyway</h2><p>For many Canadians accustomed to a life of travel, the last year and half has only made their feelings of wanderlust grow stronger.</p><p>While the delta variant has complicated plans for a post-pandemic future where it&#x27;s safe to travel without reservations, many people are still planning to head south in the coming months.</p><p>Air Canada, Air Transat and Sunwing all say the upcoming fall and winter looks promising for travel to sun destinations.</p><p>&quot;When looking to the sun market, we are very optimistic about our recovery,&quot; Air Canada spokesperson Peter Fitzpatrick told CBC News in a recent email. He noted the airline is currently &quot;observing demand growth that is above 2019 levels.&quot;</p><p>Despite this increased demand, the federal government is still feeling uneasy about people travelling internationally.</p><p>In an email to CBC News, Global Affairs Canada said its still advising against non-essential travel outside of Canada and also pointed to practical concerns for those who do choose to go abroad.</p><p>&quot;Additional travel restrictions can be imposed suddenly.

It happened to this student</h2><p>A first-year Western University student who arrived in London, Ont., from Saskatchewan says she had a rental agreement cancelled at the last minute by a landlord who said she didn&#x27;t like her tattoos. <br/> <br/> Kadince Ball, 18, started school at Western earlier this month and secured an apartment ahead of her move. She&#x27;d already signed a lease and paid her damage deposit, but shortly after she met her landlord Esther Lee in person, Lee told her that she couldn&#x27;t move in.<br/> <br/> &quot;A lease was signed and because I look a certain way, I was denied tenancy,&quot; said Ball. &quot;None of my tattoos are offensive. They are works of art. They are somebody&#x27;s works of art on my body.&quot; <br/> <br/> Lee told CBC News she moved to cancel the lease because she became &quot;scared&quot; after seeing Ball&#x27;s tattoos. The day the two first met in person, it was hot and Ball was wearing a tank top that showed her tattoos, which include a snake wrapped around a flower on her forearm, a cherub on one shoulder and a flower on the other shoulder <br/> <br/> &quot;It covered almost 70 per cent of her arm,&quot; said Lee. &quot;That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t want to rent it to her because it&#x27;s scary, so scary.&quot;<br/> <br/> Ball eventually found another apartment. She&#x27;s more concerned with her studies than pursuing legal action. But a lawyer at the Community Legal Services Clinic at Western says if she chose to bring the incident to small claims court, she likely would have a case. <a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/XNAWC49qqfAl6BMFNvfc6?domain=newsletters.cbc.ca">Read more<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a></p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Kadince Ball "><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Kadince Ball </p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Kadince Ball signed a lease for an apartment in London, Ont., before arriving from Saskatchewan for her first year at Western University.

The answer is lower than we once thought</h2><p>The World Health Organization said earlier this week that the harmful health effects of air pollution kick in at lower levels than it previously thought.<br/> <br/> As a result, the WHO is setting a higher bar for policymakers and the public in its first update to its air quality guidelines in 15 years. <br/> <br/> Exposure to air pollution is estimated to cause seven million premature deaths and affect the health of millions more people each year, and air pollution &quot;is now recognized as the single-biggest environmental threat to human health,&quot; said Dr. Dorota Jarosinska, WHO Europe program manager for living and working environments.<br/> <br/> Air pollution is now comparable to other global health risks such as unhealthy diets and tobacco smoking, WHO said. <a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/FGRWC7AwwFjZyA4fr3f8V?domain=newsletters.cbc.ca">Read more<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a></p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Pakistan Air Pollution"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Pakistan Air Pollution</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Vehicles drive on a highway as smog envelops the area of Lahore, Pakistan, on Nov. 11, 2020.
