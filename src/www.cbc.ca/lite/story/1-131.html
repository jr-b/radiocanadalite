Eventually, the model will be standard, but right now, &quot;Hamilton really is the leader,&quot; he said.</p><p>CityHousing Hamilton (CHH), the city&#x27;s largest social housing provider, owns 500 MacNab. The tower previously held 146 social rent-geared-to-income (RGI) units, and mostly bachelor apartments. Now it&#x27;s a seniors&#x27; building with mix of studio and one-bedrooms, and only 114 units are RGI. The rest are market rent. </p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.4597300">City housing agency takes on &#x27;ambitious&#x27; rebuilding plan</a></li></ul></p><p>Tom Hunter, CHH president, says the remaining 32 RGI units will be reallocated to other CHH Hamilton buildings. Fifteen will be at First Place on King Street East, and the rest are undetermined. </p><p>The tower sat vacant for more than a year while CHH renovated. It spent about $34 million using money from the municipal, provincial and federal governments, and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities.</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
