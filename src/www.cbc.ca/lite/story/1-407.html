So individual A might grow very, very rapidly and then individual B might grow very, very slowly.... So it&#x27;s really almost impossible to age lobsters currently.&quot;</p><p>Other methods, such as examining proteins in a lobster&#x27;s brain, or growth rings in its eye stalks, cannot be used on a living lobster.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Lobsters"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Lobsters</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: These lobsters, which are about one or two months old, were raised from eggs and used to help develop the aging model.  (Martin Taylor/University of East Anglia)</p></div></div></p><p>Taylor and the research team have developed a DNA-based method of pinpointing the age of younger lobsters to within 1.6 months. The <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/eva.13296">study was published<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> in the journal Evolutionary Applications.</p><p>The researchers obtained lobsters raised from eggs so they would know their exact age. They then took tissue samples from the lobsters&#x27; claws and measured DNA methylation, which is known to decrease with age.</p><p>They used that data to build a model to estimate the age of wild lobsters, most of which were estimated at between 40 and 55 months old, or about 3.5 to 4.5 years old.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.3591026">Lobster size minimums to increase, say federal officials</a></li></ul></p><p>&quot;We&#x27;ve demonstrated the sort of proof-of-concept that we can do it. But the thing is, lobsters live for a very, very long time,&quot; Taylor said.</p><p>The known-age lobsters in the study were only up to 51 months old, or just over four years. But European lobsters — the type examined in the study — can live for 70 or more years, and American lobsters can live longer, possibly even a century.</p><p>&quot;If we catch a lobster and we want to age it that&#x27;s 70 years, then we&#x27;re extrapolating a long way beyond our known age range, so it starts to become much more difficult to be certain,&quot; Taylor said.</p><p>The researchers hope to expand their study to include older, known-aged lobsters.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Lobster"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Lobster</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: This is a juvenile lobster. The researchers developed the model using younger lobsters, up to about five years old, but some lobsters can survive for 70 years or more.  (Martin Taylor/University of East Anglia)</p></div></div></p><h2>Why age matters</h2><p>The research could one day lead to the creation of a device that could be used on lobster fishing boats to check the age of an individual, Taylor said.</p><p>&quot;The ultimate goal might be that you can take catch and ... take a small DNA sample and almost instantly sequence it and say, &#x27;Okay, well, this one&#x27;s very, very young. We shouldn&#x27;t keep that....&#x27; We&#x27;re a long way from that at the moment, but it&#x27;s not an impossibility.&quot;</p><p>In the meantime, Taylor said, the DNA technique could be used to gain a better understanding of the age of lobster stock and stock health, and manage it more sustainably.</p><p>&quot;An unhealthy age structure leads to a less resilient fishery. So if you&#x27;ve got lots of old individuals or lots of young individuals in the fishery, then they&#x27;re less able to be resilient to environmental change, for instance.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Lobster"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Lobster</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: This lobster, which is about five years old, was raised in a sea cage and then in an indoor raceway as part of the study.  (Martin Taylor/University of East Anglia)</p></div></div></p><p>Fraser Clark, an assistant professor in the department of animal science and aquaculture at Dalhousie University, said calculating age in crustaceans is difficult and sometimes controversial.</p><p>&quot;At meetings I&#x27;ve been at whenever there&#x27;s an approach that&#x27;s been suggested, it causes not outright fights, but minor discussions of very differing views,&quot;  he said.</p><p>Clark said the study is &quot;interesting&quot; and it&#x27;s &quot;fun&quot; to age lobsters, but the team&#x27;s data on age estimates for wild lobsters was very variable, so &quot;they&#x27;ve got a bit of work to do.&quot;</p><p>He added that lobster age is not necessarily the best tool to manage the fishery for sustainability.</p><p>&quot;Knowing the age may or may not help us know whether or not they are reproductively active. But the size is a very easy metric that the industry uses now to determine whether or not there&#x27;s a legal catch.&quot;</p><p><strong>MORE TOP STORIES</strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6186787">Eskasoni aims to vaccinate 100 per cent of eligible population</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6186703">Internal email shows bureaucrats worried Owls Head talking points were misleading</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6187127">Love from Lebanon: The story of Halifax&#x27;s Joanne and George Korkomaz</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6187553">Dozens protest outside DFO office in Dartmouth over Mi&#x27;kmaw treaty rights</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6187589">How thinking inside the box solved shortage of ship time for ocean researchers</a></li></ul></p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
