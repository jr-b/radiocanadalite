She believes the party is laying the foundation for growth. </p><h2>&#x27;More needs to be done to support local ridings&#x27;</h2><p>But McGrath also believes a lack of on-campus voting, long line-ups for the ballot box and fewer polling station locations —  <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6183246">some absent from Indigenous communities</a> —  suppressed the NDP vote. </p><p>&quot;Part of the reason for having the election at this time was to keep the turnout numbers low in order to re-elect the incumbent government,&quot; McGrath said.</p><p>&quot;I do believe that young voters and Indigenous voters, in particular, were disenfranchised.&quot;</p><p>McGrath said NDP fundraising is still strong and she feels confident the party will have the finances to put up a fight in the next election. </p><p><em><strong>WATCH | NDP tries to get out the vote using TikTok</strong></em></p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Embed  | Miscellaneous"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Embed  | Miscellaneous</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY"> </p></div></div></p><p>But McLean said NDP donations in York–Simcoe, a Conservative stronghold, ran dry after the party had to battle first in a February 2019 byelection, then the October 2019 election. She said the riding&#x27;s resources were still depleted by the time Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made the August election call this year. </p><p>McLean said her riding can usually rely on Elections Canada campaign-expense reimbursements — money that commonly flows to candidates and helps electoral district associations or ridings — but New Democrat headquarters kept all the rebates in 2019 and again this year. </p><p>McLean said money is usually raised at nomination meetings, but the NDP didn&#x27;t hold one in her riding before the snap election was called for Sept. 20. </p><p>&quot;We were left with almost no funds to start off this campaign, and we didn&#x27;t find out who our candidate would be until a week into the campaign,&quot; McLean said.</p><p>&quot;By the time we went to our members and said, &#x27;Oh, we have a candidate now,&#x27; we looked completely unorganized.
