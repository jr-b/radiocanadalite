Master Gardeners start out as master gardeners-in-training until they complete the educational and volunteer component of the mandate. Master Gardeners and master gardeners-in-training provide free garden advice to the public by participating in volunteer activities such as garden advice clinics, answering questions via email and now in online chats.</p><h2><strong>Need more help?
