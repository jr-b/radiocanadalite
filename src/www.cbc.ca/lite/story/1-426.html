(Andrew Lee/CBC)</p></div></div></p><p>&quot;The test for beginning our taper is that we&#x27;ve achieved substantial further progress toward our goal of inflation and maximum employment,&quot; Powell told reporters at the Wednesday virtual news conference. He said that members of the committee that make U.S. monetary policy are convinced the bank has already over-achieved its goal on inflation.</p><p>&quot;Many on the committee feel that the substantial further progress test for employment has been met,&quot; he said, although progress on jobs had been slowed because &quot;delta happened.&quot;</p><p>More than half of that committee foresees the actual bank interest rates beginning to rise by next year, coming closer to estimates of private sector economists who have already anticipated a half-point hike in 2022. </p><h2>Chinese property contagion</h2><p>While Powell recognized some the headwinds faced by the global and U.S. economy, he seemed confident that they would not impede the progress of the economy in meeting the bank&#x27;s employment goals.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6185226">Evergrande strikes deal to meet Chinese bond payment, but foreign dollar investors still up in air</a></li></ul></p><p>For example, he said there was no sign that the China property crisis, specifically <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6179508">the threatened default of Evergrande</a> that has led to tightening of credit throughout China&#x27;s enormous home-building sector, would have a direct effect on U.S. corporate defaults that he saw as continuing to be &quot;very low.&quot;</p><p>&quot;In terms of the implications for the U.S., there&#x27;s not a lot of direct United States exposure,&quot; said Powell. &quot;But you know, you would worry that it would affect global financial conditions through confidence channels.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | China building demolition"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | China building demolition</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: A still from video of unneeded buildings being demolished in China prompted worries that financial trouble at property giant Evergrande were a symptom of a much bigger problem.  (thepaper.cn)</p></div></div></p><p>The other thing that could threaten U.S. economic stability this autumn is another battle in Congress over raising the debt ceiling limit, an issue that has got less attention in Canada than in the past because of domestic election coverage.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s just very important that the debt ceiling be raised in a timely fashion so that the United States can pay its bills,&quot; said Powell. &quot;The failure to do that could result in severe reactions, severe damage to the economy and the financial system.&quot;</p><p>In the past, after playing chicken for a number of weeks, Congress has always managed to hammer out an agreement to prevent the government from defaulting but so long as that threat lingers, there is a possibility the plan to begin tapering would be delayed.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6137217">U.S. Senate Democrats pass sweeping $3.5T US spending plan</a></li></ul></p><p>Ever since Powell&#x27;s comments that he was not even &quot;<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6067671">talking about talking about</a>&quot; cutting stimulus, the world&#x27;s most powerful central banker has promised that he would not begin scaling back on the purchase of bonds until he had announced it to the world.</p><p>Many expected he would delay again. This week, the OECD, the rich countries&#x27; economic think tank, advised governments and central banks to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/oecd-still-too-early-ease-economic-support-despite-inflation-spike-2021-09-21/">hold off on cutting stimulus<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a>. But Powell&#x27;s decision is still not final.</p><p>With things like Evergrande, the debt ceiling and the uncertainty of the delta variant, and even the potential effect of a new taper tantrum, Powell said the choice of whether to step on the bottom of the interest rates escalator will actually come in November, the next time he&#x27;s scheduled to hold a news conference.</p><p>&quot;We could easily move ahead at the next meeting,&quot; said Powell, sounding confident, before quickly adding, &quot;Or not.&quot; </p><p><em>Follow Don on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/don_pittis">@don_pittis<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a></em></p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
