(Alexander Panetta/CBC)</p></div></div></p><p>Authorities tried desperately to keep them away from the media, but Jean-Charles spotted a famous Haitian journalist in the crowd and made a beeline for the press row near the bus.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m so proud, so proud to [meet you],&quot; he said to his countryman in their native Creole.</p><p>He later described his week at the camp, which began with a struggle to get food and water, requiring frequent trips across the river to Mexico.</p><p>Now he&#x27;s headed for Connecticut, where he has an uncle and cousins. He&#x27;ll file for asylum and try starting a life there, he said.</p><p>&quot;We&#x27;re happy,&quot; he said, offering a thumbs up before boarding the bus.</p><p>He predicted some of the migrants will try coming to Canada to join its Haitian communities.</p><h2>&#x27;It&#x27;s reached a boiling point&#x27;</h2><p>Texas lawyer Elissa Steglich said that, among the six cases of Haitian migrants she&#x27;s worked on, one hoped to head to Canada.</p><p>She called the U.S. asylum system both inhumane and incompetent. It&#x27;s plagued by court delays, she said, and prone to treating desperate migrants like criminals, frequently storing them in old prisons repurposed as immigration centres.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s reached a boiling point [in Del Rio],&quot; said Steglich, co-director of the immigration clinic at the University of Texas School of Law.</p><p>&quot;What we&#x27;re seeing is unprecedented brutality from the U.S. government against asylum seekers.&quot;</p><h2>Waiting for word</h2><p>Kroeger&#x27;s friend communicated with him throughout her journey.</p><p>She texted last week to say she was on a plane from Santiago, Chile, to Mexico City.</p><p>She made video calls from inside the camp.</p><p>In one brief call Thursday morning, she told CBC News that she was doing well — she was told she&#x27;d be processed in 15 minutes.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6188445">View hosts test positive for COVID, are pulled from set ahead of Kamala Harris interview</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6187613">U.S. vaccination requirement for air passengers worries Canadians with mixed vaccines</a></li></ul></p><p>Hours later, she remained in limbo. &quot;I&#x27;m very afraid,&quot; she wrote in a text Thursday afternoon.</p><p>She said she was being taken somewhere else and didn&#x27;t know where. &quot;Maybe in a prison,&quot; she wrote.</p><p>Then the texts stopped.</p><p>Kroeger kept trying to reach her and got no replies. He chased rumours about where she might be. He drove around town, from one bus pickup location to another, staking them out in his car with Ohio plates.</p><p>So, as of late Friday, the Trump supporter who believes in a wall and stricter borders was staring into crowds of foreign faces, at <a href="https://www.nps.gov/stli/learn/historyculture/colossus.htm"><u>the tired, the poor and the weary</u><img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a>, looking for a friend.</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
