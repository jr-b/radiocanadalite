HCA staff will continue to monitor levels and is asking people to exercise caution around the slippery banks of waterways.</p><p>&quot;So far so good,&quot; said Bastien. &quot;There&#x27;s nothing really concerning.&quot;</p><p>As for the rest of fall, Chen said the long-term weather models don&#x27;t offer many clues of what to expect.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s a toss-up. I would advise people to be prepared to anything,&quot; he said. &quot;Fall and winter are the season that keep on giving with systems that bring rain, wind and snow.&quot;</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
