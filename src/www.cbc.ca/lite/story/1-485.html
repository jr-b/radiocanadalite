The law doesn&#x27;t say that an oral promise is any less binding than a written promise.&quot;</p><p>But even those who do have proof are finding it hard to get what they were promised.</p><p>Schultz had plenty of evidence, but that didn&#x27;t seem to help him with Bell.</p><p>When he first spoke with an agent on Feb. 27, he thought it was a done deal, because that&#x27;s what the agent told him. In the recording — which Go Public heard — the agent clearly says all Schultz needs to do is go to his local Bell store to pick up the new phone and the data offer would kick in.</p><p>Schultz even asked for a confirmation number, and was told he didn&#x27;t need one because everything was noted on his account.</p><p><em><strong>LISTEN | Schultz promised deal:</strong></em> </p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Media Video | Bell agent promises deal to Walter Schultz"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Media Video | Bell agent promises deal to Walter Schultz</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY"> </p></div></div></p><p>But when he arrived at the store that same day, no one knew anything about any offer.</p><p>Schultz called customer service again — and again was told he qualified for the deal he was promised. This time, the agent said the telco would send the new phone and contract directly to him.</p><p>The contract arrived in an email on March 2, with only 5 GB — half the data that was promised for the same money. </p><p>Refusing to give up, Schultz followed up with a third Bell agent in an online chat — and yet again was told there was no problem, that the deal would show up on his billing.</p><p>It never did. Instead, on March 29, he got a message from Bell saying he couldn&#x27;t have the offer because, &quot;the plan in question does not exist.&quot;</p><p>Schultz complained to the CCTS but Bell refused to budge.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Josée Thibault, Assistant Commissioner at the CCTS"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Josée Thibault, Assistant Commissioner at the CCTS</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Josée Thibault, assistant commissioner at the CCTS, says telcos are expected to provide documentation about agreements.

He says it&#x27;s not about the cost at this point.</p><p>&quot;All I wanted was for them to honour their word. It was a very simple thing.&quot;</p><h2>Bell battles customers over contracts</h2><p>Bell has been fighting some of these complaints through the CCTS and through the courts. </p><p>In one case, the CCTS found in favour of a customer who said, in May 2019, he was verbally offered a fixed price &quot;guaranteed for life&quot; for TV, internet and phone services that Bell later reneged, by claiming the offer didn&#x27;t exist.</p><p>The CCTS scolded Bell after it said the recording of that conversation wasn&#x27;t available — even though the telco said it had listened to the recording as part of its internal investigation into that same complaint.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | David Ramsay"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | David Ramsay</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: David Ramsay took Bell to court and won after the telecom giant refused to honour a verbal contract he made with a call centre agent.

At least honour that mistake,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;There are some legal reasons why they might have to do that anyway [if] the individual&#x27;s led to reasonably believe an offer was available.&quot;</p><p>He says the biggest problem for consumers<strong> </strong>is &quot;accessing justice,&quot; because it&#x27;s often too expensive to enforce consumer rights if a telco refuses to budge and the CCTS rules against the complainant. </p><p>&quot;Already consumers always feel that they&#x27;re in a weaker position, and I think they are, which is why we have legislation to protect them… but what are [they] going to do?
