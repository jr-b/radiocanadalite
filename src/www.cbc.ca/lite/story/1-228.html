As time went on, and health care fell under government&#x27;s purview, knitting for NONIA became a way for women to earn extra income to support their families.</p><p>That continues to this day, with some of the about 130 people who currently knit for NONIA on hand for the statue&#x27;s unveiling Tuesday.</p><p>Florence Rose has been with the group for over 35 years, continuing a tradition of NONIA knitting passed on from her mother in Salmon Cove. She said it was a great experience to see the statue and share her love of knitting with others.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s really something you&#x27;ll always remember,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#x27;s beautiful, really something.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | NONIA knitting statue"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | NONIA knitting statue</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: The statue includes a real ball of yarn and piece of knitting that were cast in bronze.

She&#x27;s been a NONIA knitter for 32 years.</p><p>&quot;I saw a little article that NONIA was looking for knitters. [I sent] a little piece of knitting into them, and it came back with a big box of wool. And I&#x27;ve been knitting for them ever since,&quot; she said, laughing.</p><h2>The &#x27;magic&#x27; of knitted goods</h2><p>The statue was a chance to reflect on NONIA&#x27;s roots, and its continued impact.</p><p>&quot;Now NONIA is more about the knitting heritage and the skills. And NONIA in itself, it seems to me, has become a valued Newfoundland asset. It&#x27;s something that people from away … are very interested in,&quot; Keelin O&#x27;Leary, NONIA&#x27;s manager, told CBC Radio&#x27;s <em>Weekend AM</em>.</p><p>&quot;We kind of take these things for granted now because we&#x27;ve grown up with them, and we&#x27;re so used to having them around us. But people who are not familiar with hand-knitted goods think it&#x27;s magic.&quot;</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5587985">NONIA at 100: Legendary knitwear manufacturer has quite the history</a></li></ul></p><p>The statue of a grandmother teaching her granddaughter knitting techniques perfectly captures the group and the heritage of passing knitting on to the next generation, said O&#x27;Leary.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Yvonne Sheppard and Florence Rose"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Yvonne Sheppard and Florence Rose</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Florence Rose, left, and Yvonne Sheppard have been knitting for NONIA for decades.
