Their takeout is still going strong. </p><p>He doesn&#x27;t, however, believe Emery&#x27;s post will have a negative impact on business due to the support he received online as a result of the tweet. </p><p>Despite Emery claiming he won&#x27;t return to King of the Pigs, Vieira would eventually have him back. </p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6184065">Getting veggies at London&#x27;s 2 farmers markets?
