The legislation gives everyone rights of access over land and inland waters throughout Scotland.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | IATNL-Humber-Valley-Trail"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | IATNL-Humber-Valley-Trail</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: The Humber Valley Trail is part of the International Appalachian Trail.
