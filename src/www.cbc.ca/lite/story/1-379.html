It was Hamilton&#x27;s fifth win of the season and his first since the British Grand Prix in July.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s a magical moment,&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;I could only have dreamed of still being here and having this opportunity to win these races and get to drive with such phenomenal talents this late in my career.&quot;</p><p>Hamilton turned Verstappen&#x27;s five-point championship lead into a two-point lead of his own as the Dutch driver finished second after a dramatic drive from last on the grid.

If not for the rain, Hamilton said, &quot;it would have been tough to get past Lando. He had great pace.&quot; Norris had been aiming to give McLaren back-to-back wins after Daniel Ricciardo took victory at the last race in Italy when Hamilton and Verstappen collided.</p><p><em><strong>WATCH l Hamilton, Verstappen involved in a huge crash at British Grand Prix:</strong></em></p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Media Video | Max Verstappen, Lewis Hamilton involved in a huge crash at British Grand Prix"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Media Video | Max Verstappen, Lewis Hamilton involved in a huge crash at British Grand Prix</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Red Bull&#x27;s Max Verstappen and Mercedes&#x27; Lewis Hamilton collide as they battle for the Formula 1 world championship at the Silverstone Circuit. </p></div></div></p><p>Hamilton has now won the Russian Grand Prix on five of eight occasions, and his victory Sunday continues a clean sweep of victories in Russia for Mercedes cars.</p><p>Ricciardo narrowly missed the podium for McLaren in fourth and Hamilton&#x27;s teammate Valtteri Bottas was fifth after an eventful race for the Finn. Mercedes&#x27; decision to swap the engine in Bottas&#x27; car and take a penalty prompted speculation the team was deploying Bottas to hold up Verstappen, something the team denied. Regardless, it didn&#x27;t take long for Verstappen to swoop past Bottas.</p><p>Alonso was sixth for Alpine, ahead of Norris and Alfa Romeo&#x27;s Kimi Raikkonen. The second Red Bull of Sergio Perez was ninth and George Russell took the last point for Williams in 10th. Russell qualified third and held up the cars behind — including Hamilton, his teammate next year at Mercedes — for much of the early part of the race.</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
