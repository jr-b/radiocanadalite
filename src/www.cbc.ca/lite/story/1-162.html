The school thanked EMS workers for their commitment to keeping students safe. </p><p>The statement reminded students who attended the events to visit the on-campus testing centre if they&#x27;re experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. </p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
