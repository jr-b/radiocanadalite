When she asks if they knew what was in the vaccines their kids received as babies, the response is usually no, she said.</p><p>&quot;I completely respect and understand how there would be some fear associated with it,&quot; she said. </p><p>But ultimately, &quot;we trusted our doctors then and we trusted the science then, and we need to do the same with this vaccine.&quot; </p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | cora "><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | cora </p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Dr. Cora Constantinescu said that as parents approach the decision, they should consider the negative impacts of COVID-19 on children.
