(Paul Jones/CBC)</p></div></div></p><p>Newfoundland and Labrador Health Minister John Haggie will be meeting with a group of tech entrepreneurs from Memorial University on Tuesday to review an application they designed that could be part of the province&#x27;s vaccine passport system. </p><p>Noah Côté and Austin Aiken, co-founders of Mdium, a company that specializes in secure data transfer, have developed a product during a work term at the Memorial Centre for Entrepreneurship to facilitate the transfer of photos between devices. </p><p>That product eventually became the basis for VaccPass, an app and website that provides users with a numerical or QR code once they upload proof of vaccination. </p><p>Businesses and events can then scan a code on a smartphone or a printout to access patrons&#x27; vaccination statuses before granting them access.</p><p>The system is similar to one launched in Quebec on Sept. 1 and rolling out in Saskatchewan later this month. </p><p>Blaine Edwards, entrepreneur-in-residence at health-care consulting company Bounce Health Innovation, met with Mdium earlier this year to review the possible use of their technology in that sector.</p><p>&quot;Just through the serendipity of innovation, it was announced that the province was going to roll out a vaccine passport,&quot; Edwards said.</p><p>&quot;After a few hours of reviewing the new technology and the standards, we decided that this was an absolutely possible application that could be modified for that purpose.&quot; </p><h2>A homegrown solution?</h2><p>Côté says the company plans to modify VaccPass to require users to upload government-issued ID, along with a photo, to verify the integrity of the person creating the account. The QR code will be issued once the identity has been verified.</p><p>This feature will distinguish VaccPass from Quebec&#x27;s system in that it will allow ID integration, meaning users will not have to present photo ID when scanning their code.</p><p>&quot;We want to build an all-in-one solution to this that would cover both aspects of that,&quot; Côté said.</p><p>Edwards said Tuesday&#x27;s meeting with Minister Haggie will be an opportunity to &quot;show off the technology.&quot; A media release from the provincial government Monday afternoon said Sarah Stoodley, minister of digital government and Service N.L., would be at a COVID-19 briefing Tuesday afternoon to provide an update on the provincial government&#x27;s vaccine-passport plans.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Blaine Edwards"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Blaine Edwards</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Blaine Edwards, entrepreneur-in-residence at Bounce Health Innovation in St. John&#x27;s, helped oversee the creation of VaccPass, an app that could form the basis of the province&#x27;s vaccine passport.
