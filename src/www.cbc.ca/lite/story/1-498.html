Don Noble died from a rare spinal cancer in late 2016. </p><p>&quot;Basically, they want an order from the court to give me what my husband owned and it is already bequeathed to me... it&#x27;s very strange,&quot; Noble, 66, told Go Public.</p><blockquote class="pullquote">  His last words to me that night were &#x27;You will have to write the book.&#x27;  <cite class="pullquote-source">- Carol Anne Noble</cite> </blockquote><p>Experts say that tech companies refusing to hand over digital assets is a problem affecting everything from stocks, insurance policies and PayPal to gaming credits, social media posts and family photos.</p><p>It&#x27;s a &quot;big&quot; problem that will &quot;only get bigger,&quot; leaving Canadians at the mercy of the U.S.-based companies and their rules, said Peter Lown, an online assets expert and director emeritus of the Alberta Law Reform Institute at the University of Alberta in Edmonton.</p><ul>   <li><strong>Are you facing an uphill battle with a company?

She sent all the documents the company asked for, including his death certificate and the will designating her as executor.</p><p>&quot;They called me back and said, no, that&#x27;s not good enough — you have to have a court order [but] having to pay to put in a court order is a huge deal,&quot; she said. </p><p>Court orders can cost from about $2,000 to tens of thousands of dollars — depending on whether they&#x27;re opposed. </p><p>After going back and forth with Apple for years, Noble, out of desperation, hired a lawyer earlier this year to help navigate the company&#x27;s demands.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s a tricky situation,&quot; said Dheeraj Sindhwani, Noble&#x27;s lawyer, who practises family law in Ontario.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Carol Anne Noble"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Carol Anne Noble</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Without the password for her late husband&#x27;s account, Noble can&#x27;t access his journal entries.
