(Lam Yik/Bloomberg)</p></div></div></p><p>That includes an $83.5 million US payment due Thursday to buyers abroad of a U.S. dollar-denominated bond. The company has a month to pay before it would be declared in default.</p><h2>Competing interests</h2><p>Economists say any government action is likely to focus on protecting Chinese families that paid for apartments that are yet to built, rather than on bailing out banks or other creditors.</p><p>Beijing has resources to prevent a Chinese credit crunch if Evergrande defaults. But it doesn&#x27;t want to appear to organize a bailout while it tries to force others to cut debt, economists say. The ruling Communist Party worries surging debt that piled up during China&#x27;s boom years might cause problems as economic growth slows.</p><p>On Thursday, one of Evergrande&#x27;s biggest shareholders, Chinese Estates Holdings Ltd., announced it sold part of its stake at a loss and might sell its remaining 5.66 per cent of the company. Chinese Estates said it took a 1.4 billion Hong Kong dollar ($177 million US) loss.</p><p>Evergrande&#x27;s debt problems come at a time when Chinese economic growth is forecast to weaken due to a slowdown in construction and home sales due to government pressure on the real estate industry to reduce reliance on borrowed money.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6185226">Evergrande strikes deal to meet Chinese bond payment, but foreign dollar investors still up in air</a></li></ul></p><p>On Thursday, Fitch Ratings cut its growth forecast for China this year to 8.1 per cent — still among the world&#x27;s strongest — from 8.4 per cent, citing the real estate slowdown.</p><p>Meanwhile, S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded the debt of a smaller Chinese developer, Xinyuan Real Estate Co., which has delayed releasing 2020 results. S&amp;P said Xinyuan, which has shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, faces &quot;refinancing difficulty&quot; that will make it harder to service $229 million in debt due to lenders abroad in October.</p><p>Hundreds of smaller Chinese developers have gone bankrupt since Beijing started tightening financial controls on the industry in 2017.</p><h2>China&#x27;s &#x27;Lehman moment?&#x27;</h2><p>Some commentators suggested Evergrande might become a &quot;Lehman moment,&quot; invoking the 2008 collapse of Wall Street bank Lehman Brothers ahead of the global crisis. But economists say Evergrande&#x27;s debts are relatively simple compared with those of a Wall Street bank and appear unlikely to set off a chain reaction.</p><p>Evergrande&#x27;s debt is the equivalent of as much as 2 per cent of China&#x27;s annual economic output, but economists say the state-owned banking industry can absorb a possible default.</p><p>&quot;There will be some banks exposed,&quot; said ING&#x27;s Carnell. &quot;The big ones can cope.
