But building codes and real estate sale transactions are in provincial jurisdiction, not municipal.</p><p>And provincially, as well as in some U.S. states, lobbyists from the real estate industry have pushed back against a labelling policy.</p><p>In 2018, the Ontario Real Estate Association lobbied against a proposal that would have made energy audits mandatory before selling homes and required results to be tied to homes&#x27; listings. At the time, the industry group argued the program would create red tape and hurt owners of older homes.</p><p><a href="https://www.oreablog.com/index.php/province-puts-the-brakes-on-punishing-herd-program/">In a blog post<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a>, the association said its staff and volunteers lobbied almost every member of the Ontario cabinet, including then-premier Kathleen Wynne.</p><p>When the Ontario government repealed the act that included the policy, the association celebrated it as &quot;a big win.&quot; </p><p>The federal government faces a similar jurisdictional challenge, but the Liberal Party promised that if re-elected, it would require EnerGuide labels on homes at the time of sale. (EnerGuide is the federal government&#x27;s rating and labelling program for products, vehicles and homes.)</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6138366">Edmonton declared a climate emergency in 2019.
