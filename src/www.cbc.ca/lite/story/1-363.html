They&#x27;re used vehicles,&quot; said Layson.</p><p>He says North American automakers have been hit the hardest but Honda and Toyota are about to feel the pinch.</p><p>&quot;Honda and Toyota are going to cut production here in the fall, and when they stop production, there&#x27;s usually about a month to a month and a half before the dealers are actually affected. So anyone that doesn&#x27;t have anything on their lot right now and production stops, it&#x27;s going to be a long time for those dealer lots to be restocked,&quot; said Layson.</p><p>The Stellantis Windsor Assembly Plant goes back into production this week after being idled for several months. The plant has only produced minivans for 12 weeks this year.</p><p>When that plant goes down, it affects the feeder plants that produce parts for the plant.</p><ul>   <li> <p><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6102508">Windsor Assembly Plant on hiatus for the rest of July</a></p> </li>   <li> <p><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5999900">Employees &#x27;concerned&#x27; as timeline of Windsor Assembly Plant shutdown remains uncertain</a></p> </li>  </ul><p>The shutdowns have resulted in thousands of job losses in the manufacturing sector, contributing to the region&#x27;s unemployment rate of 10.6 per cent — three points higher than the provincial average.</p><p>&quot;In the Windsor [Census metropolitan area], we would typically have about 40,000 to 41,000 jobs employed in manufacturing. That would be full-time and part-time, and this year we&#x27;re at about 33,200 jobs in manufacturing,&quot; said Justin Falconer, CEO of Workforce WindsorEssex.</p><p>J.P.

President Emile Nabbout says the federal government needs to work with a private firm to create a microchip production facility here in Windsor so we don&#x27;t have to rely on offshore imports.</p><p>&quot;It would be something we could do as a Canadian-made product,&quot; said Nabbout.</p><p>However, Layson says it will take many years to get the &quot;very expensive, very detailed, very complex microchip factories and so to get one up and running to solve this problem isn&#x27;t going to happen.&quot;</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6124278">Dealerships scramble to find new vehicles as inventory crisis deepens</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6073271">Why it might be wise to hold off on buying a car for a little while longer</a></li></ul></p><p>He expects the shortage to continue into the middle of next year.</p><p>Meanwhile, Unifor officials are working with MPs to get the federal government to extend unemployment benefits because Nabbout said the workers are having a tough time gaining enough weeks worked to qualify for benefits.</p><p>He says some of the feeder plants are also struggling to stay afloat.</p><p>&quot;If you don&#x27;t produce, how do you pay the bills?&quot; he said.</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
