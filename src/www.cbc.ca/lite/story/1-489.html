‘loot-boxes,’ which have been the subject of lawsuits because of alleged links to gambling. </p></div></div></div><div><p>A gaming insider says an internal company document proves video game giant Electronic Arts is trying to drive players into a type of game play that encourages them to spend more money and which has come under fire for possible links to gambling. </p><p>The leaked 54-page document comes from the company&#x27;s sports division in Burnaby, B.C., where a team works on EA&#x27;s hugely profitable <em>FIFA </em>soccer games. It appears to be a presentation, featuring numerous slides with bullet points, about the release of <em>FIFA 21 </em>and was shared internally.</p><p>It discusses a mode of play that lets players buy &quot;loot boxes&quot; within the game to improve play or increase their chances of winning, such as by adding a better player to their team.</p><p>It says the mode that allows loot box purchases, called FIFA Ultimate Team (FUT), is the &quot;cornerstone&quot; of the game.</p><p>&quot;We are doing everything we can to drive players there,&quot; a bullet point close to the top of <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/20690134/run-up-to-fifa-5-things-you-need-to-know.pdf"><u>the document</u><img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> says. </p><ul>   <li><a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/20690561/ea_merged.pdf"><strong>View the EA documents</strong><img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a></li>   <li><strong>Got a story?

Critics say that randomness — coupled with bells and whistles that go off when a box opens within the game — makes them addictive and akin to gambling.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Gaming insider"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Gaming insider</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: A gaming insider tells CBC’s Go Public that video game giant Electronic Arts is funnelling FIFA 21 players towards &#x27;loot boxes&#x27;, which have been the subject of lawsuits because of alleged links to gambling.  (CBC)</p></div></div></p><p>&quot;The features of a loot box are similar to a slot machine,&quot; said Keith Whyte, executive director of the U.S. National Council on Problem Gaming. &quot;Nothing is more attractive — and in some people, addictive — to the brain than intermittent, variable reward.&quot; </p><p>Indeed, online message boards and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/l3iggz/please_seek_help_if_youre_addicted_to_packs_like/"><u>forums</u><img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> are flooded with people who admit they&#x27;re trying to break free from loot-box addiction and experts such as Whyte say they&#x27;re increasingly hearing from problem gamblers who are spending savings and even going into debt to experience the high of opening a loot box.</p><p>Around the world, countries are grappling with whether loot boxes constitute gambling and should be banned, as Belgium did in 2018. Several lawsuits underway — including a proposed <a href="https://thepatchnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Notice-of-Civil-Claim.pdf"><u>class-action in Vancouver</u><img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> — allege EA is violating gambling legislation.</p><h2>&#x27;We can&#x27;t really do anything about it&#x27;</h2><p>It&#x27;s that backdrop that the insider says compelled him to leak the document. He says he and others he knows who work on video games don&#x27;t feel good about projects that include loot boxes. CBC News has agreed not to identify him, as he says he fears professional repercussions.</p><p>&quot;We can&#x27;t really do anything about it because at the end of the day, [the] company is trying to make money and satisfy investors.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | GAMING-E3/"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | GAMING-E3/</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: EA unveils its FIFA 16 game ahead of the Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3, in Los Angeles on June 15, 2015.     (Kevork Djansezian/Reuters)</p></div></div></p><p>An EA spokesperson declined an interview request and wouldn&#x27;t comment on the document, which, he noted, was &quot;marked privileged and confidential,&quot; other than to say it is being &quot;viewed without context&quot; and that interpretations of what it says &quot;are misinformed.&quot; When asked to clarify, he did not respond.</p><p>&quot;All EA games can be played without spending on in-game items, and the majority of players do not spend,&quot; Charlie Fortescue said in a statement.</p><p>Loot boxes are not illegal in Canada or the U.S., and many game and app companies offer similar enticements — letting players spend money on options and add-ons that enhance game play and are profitable for the companies. </p><p>And EA is earning big bucks from loot boxes.</p><p>Based on annual reports, the California-based multinational company earned $1.49 billion US in 2020 from loot boxes in its sports titles alone, almost triple the $587 million generated in 2015, according to Niko Partners, a firm that specializes in video game market analytics.</p><p>Loot boxes, also known as &quot;card packs,&quot; can be purchased with real money or &quot;coins&quot; earned in the game. But the insider says there&#x27;s pressure to cough up real cash.</p><p>&quot;You can play ... without spending a dollar,&quot; he said. &quot;But you&#x27;ll learn it takes a long time to earn coins and you&#x27;ll get frustrated pretty fast.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Console hands"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Console hands</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: EA says that all of its games can be played without spending on in-game items but that Ultimate Team modes are some of the most popular.  (CBC)</p></div></div></p><h2>Loot-box modes are optional</h2><p>He provided another, slightly shorter, internal EA document that refers to currency earned in the game as &quot;grind currency.&quot; </p><p>&quot;&#x27;Grinding&#x27; in video games is slang for doing the same monotonous task over and over again to the point where it&#x27;s no longer fun,&quot; said the insider. &quot;It seems like [EA games] are designed to be boring, to be a grind, and to encourage people of all ages to spend money on card packs.&quot; </p><p>He says the company has always emphasized that the Ultimate Team mode is optional and that players don&#x27;t have to use real money for loot boxes. So he says he was shocked to see the industry giant acknowledge that it&#x27;s doing everything it can to steer players into the mode.</p><p>&quot;For years … they&#x27;ve been able to act with a layer of plausible deniability,&quot; the insider said. &quot;Yet in their internal documents, they&#x27;re saying, &#x27;This is our goal. We want people driven to the card pack mode.&#x27;&quot;</p><p>Fortescue said the mode has been consistently popular with players.  </p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | HKN EA Sports Racism 20200610"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | HKN EA Sports Racism 20200610</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: EA, headquartered in Redwood City, Calif., earned $1.49 billion US in 2020 from loot boxes in its sports titles alone, according to Niko Partners, a firm that specializes in video game market analytics.

He&#x27;s a self-declared former loot box addict living in York, England.</p><p>&quot;I started using card packs as a way to cope at a time when I felt so unhappy in my life as a whole, when so many difficult things were going on,&quot; he said. &quot;I could essentially buy a little rush of happiness.&quot;</p><p>He spent over $5,000 — money his family had given him for his future — before getting help.</p><p>Peniket says he, too, finds the EA leaks disturbing. </p><p>&quot;<em>FIFA</em> players have thought that&#x27;s their strategy for a long time, but it&#x27;s still shocking to actually see a document from within EA stating it in writing,&quot; he said. &quot;They are driving everyone towards the casino, basically.&quot; </p><p><em><strong>WATCH | Gamer talks about allure of card packs:</strong></em></p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Media Video | Using card packs to cope"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Media Video | Using card packs to cope</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Former loot box addict Jonathan Peniket shares how much he spent on FIFA games. </p></div></div></p><p>EA has publicly denied that any facet of its video games constitute gambling.
