Though his home survived the fire, he said he understands the frustration of residents like Murray.</p><p>&quot;They&#x27;re seeing [people drive through] downtown,&quot; he said, referencing the recently reopened Highway 12, &quot;but [are being told] it&#x27;s too dangerous for them to go back to their own properties.

In the meantime, the town sat surrounded by blue fencing — and security guards making sure no one stops along the highway, or tries to get in.
