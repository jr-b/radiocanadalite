(CBC)</p></div></div></p><p>But while the damaging consequences of first-past-the-post have been most evident abroad, recent election results make it clear that Canada is stuck on the same track. By artificially shutting political parties out of ridings where they have minority support, our electoral system detaches parties from their supporters in entire regions of the country, leading to death spirals of misunderstanding and disengagement.</p><p>For example, consider Paul, a hypothetical voter in rural southern Saskatchewan. Paul is a farmer who has typically voted NDP, attracted by the party&#x27;s traditional support for rural health care, agricultural marketing boards, and public rural transportation. However, election after election, the NDP wins about 20 per cent of the vote in Paul&#x27;s region without ever winning a seat.</p><p>The resulting NDP caucuses in Ottawa are largely devoid of rural representation. The party&#x27;s elected members of parliament, overwhelmingly from urban ridings, naturally focus on issues of concern to their urban constituents: the questions the party brings up in the House of Commons are urban questions; the party&#x27;s platforms are tailored to appeal to urban areas; and the candidates who run in the party&#x27;s leadership races are urban candidates with urban concerns.</p><h2><strong>Parties harden their views</strong></h2><p>Paul, understandably, starts to suspect that rural issues have become a secondary consideration to the NDP, and begins to consider voting Conservative. The Conservatives, meanwhile, have dozens of rural MPs, but no MPs from major downtowns outside of Alberta, despite winning about 20 per cent of the vote there.</p><p>So the NDP loses Paul and other traditional rural voters to the Conservatives, and the Conservatives lose their traditional urban voters to the NDP and the Liberals. Now even more dependent on their respective urban or rural strongholds, the parties harden their region-centric views, play to their bases, and rely on turning out their supporters instead of reaching out to those outside of their core demographics. And so the cycle repeats to worse and worse extremes, resulting in the grim demographic divisions we saw on Monday.</p><p>Canada&#x27;s rural-urban divide wasn&#x27;t nearly so pronounced in decades past. As recently as the 1990s, the Liberals competed in the rural West and the Progressive Conservatives won in urban centres. But as our electoral system has progressively siloed rural and urban areas in their respective echo chambers, our regional political rifts have worsened.</p><p>Regions don&#x27;t vote, so regions shouldn&#x27;t decide elections. People should. If we truly want to address our country&#x27;s growing rural-urban divide, we need to establish a proportional, people-centric voting system.</p><hr/><p><em><strong>Do you have a strong opinion that could add insight, illuminate an issue in the news, or change how people think about an issue?
