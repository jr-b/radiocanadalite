Wanzhou.</p><p>U.S. authorities accuse Meng of using a Huawei subsidiary, Skycom, to do business in Iran in violation of U.S. economic sanctions against Iran.</p><p>Authorities allege that Meng misled an HSBC executive during a 2013 meeting about her corporation&#x27;s ties to the subsidiary. In court, Meng&#x27;s lawyers will later claim that Meng&#x27;s presentation was not misleading and that none of her actions had been shown to cause any alleged harm to the bank.</p><h2>Dec. 1, 2018: Vancouver arrest</h2><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | US China
