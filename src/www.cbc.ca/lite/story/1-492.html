You need a car that&#x27;s going to be able to weather that.&quot;</p><p>Cathy Haugen&#x27;s Honda won&#x27;t heat up either when she drives around Calgary — causing her windshield to fog up and not defrost when it&#x27;s cold and stormy. </p><p>&quot;It is a safety hazard,&quot; Haugen said of her high-end 2018 CR-V SUV which cost her almost $43,000 new.</p><p>&quot;I often have to stop halfway through my drive to get out and clear my windshield.&quot;</p><ul>   <li><strong>Got a story?

The update included new software, an oil change and, in some cases, a new air conditioning control unit. But automotive consumer advocate George Iny says, in some cases like Beaulieu and Haugen&#x27;s, it didn&#x27;t work.</p><p>&quot;If they&#x27;re not going to fix the vehicle, they need to offer people the opportunity to trade out of it or [offer] cash back for what they overpaid for a vehicle without a properly functioning heating system,&quot; said Iny, director of the Automobile Protection Association.</p><p>Problems like this go unresolved, he says, because some of Canada&#x27;s safety standards are decades out of date, so Transport Canada doesn&#x27;t see them as problems. <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/PDF/C.R.C.,_c._1038.pdf">Transport Canada&#x27;s safety standard<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> for windshield defrosting and defogging, for example, was set back in 1964.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | George Iny"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | George Iny</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Automotive consumer advocate George Iny says, in cases where Honda can&#x27;t fix the heating problem, it needs to financially compensate owners.

Shouldn&#x27;t I be able to just turn the heat on and have heat?

He sent his last complaint to Honda in February 2020 and says he didn&#x27;t hear back until just last week, after Go Public contacted the company.</p><p>Honda has now agreed to remove the block heater, reimburse him for the cost, install a different kind of heater and to try the software update that was done in 2018 again.</p><p>Haugen says after she told Honda she planned to Go Public with her complaint, the dealership agreed to update the software again and replace the climate control unit.</p><p>&quot;I was surprised. [Before that] they told me over and over that there&#x27;s nothing wrong with my climate control unit.

The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Consumer Reports and carcomplaints.com have also received heater complaints from Civic and CR-V owners.</p><p>Bordignon, from Honda, says the company has no reason to believe that &quot;this potential issue&quot; affects vehicle safety or &quot;results in any regulatory non-compliance.&quot;</p><p>In addition to the complaints, Honda owners filed a class-action lawsuit in Canada about the ongoing oil dilution problems that the company says is causing the heating issues.</p><p>The lawsuit was settled in March. But Iny says the settlement is a raw deal for drivers. He says there is nothing in it, besides an offer to cover towing charges, that Honda hadn&#x27;t already offered, leaving some drivers with no solid fix.</p><p>&quot;We&#x27;ve never seen anything like it where they didn&#x27;t fix something and then also papered it off with a settlement like this,&quot; Iny said.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5096010">Consumer group wants to hear from Honda CR-V owners involved in recall process</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5080925">When Honda refuses to fix a recalled CR-V, it gets to decide how much it&#x27;s worth</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5233505">N.S. man takes Honda to small claims court over recall buyback</a></li></ul></p><p>Beaulieu joined the class action, but rejected Honda&#x27;s settlement offer.
