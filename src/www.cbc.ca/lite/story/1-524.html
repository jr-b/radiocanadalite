Somebody was going to turn it into a play,&quot; he told <em>Day 6</em> guest host Falen Johnson. </p><p>Now, it&#x27;s been &quot;reborn&quot; as a graphic novel — an adaptation that has King excited.</p><p>&quot;I always thought it would have made something, you know, visual.&quot; </p><p><em>Borders </em>tells the story of an Indigenous mother and son who, at the Canada-U.S. border, are asked for their citizenship. When they declare they are Blackfoot, rather than Canadian or American, border guards reject their claim and they remain stuck at the &quot;line.&quot;</p><p>The story was based on King&#x27;s own experiences at border crossings, where Indigenous nationhood is not recognized.</p><p>&quot;I don&#x27;t see any reason why we can&#x27;t use identities that were here long before Canada or the U.S. ever existed, and I&#x27;m all in favour of that,&quot; said King.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Natasha Donovan"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Natasha Donovan</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Donovan says that King&#x27;s Borders has stuck with her since she read it in a Grade 11 English class.  (Lina Bell)</p></div></div></p><p>In illustrating the latest adaptation, Métis artist Natasha Donovan says she wanted to show the various ways identities that are important to people collide with the categories imposed on them.</p><p>That was something Donovan, who hails from Sasksatchewan and now lives in the United States, struggled with first-hand in the creation of the book.</p><p>&quot;We were running into this kind of crazy problem with my residency that was putting our ability to live on the same side of that line into jeopardy,&quot; she said.</p><h2>Dream project for Donovan</h2><p>King wrote the story after his time with an all-Indigenous basketball team at the University of Lethbridge.</p><p>Because he was tall and &quot;looked&quot; athletic, the team had recruited him, he recalled. &quot;It was a mistake for me to say yes. It was a mistake for them to ask me,&quot; he told Johnson, laughing.</p><p>As part of that team, King regularly crossed the border while playing against teams in the United States. Border guards would occasionally hassle him and his teammates about their citizenship.</p><p>That got King thinking: What would happen if, when Indigenous people crossed the border, they identified their citizenship as Blackfoot, and what is the worst that could happen?</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | borders page 1"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | borders page 1</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: An interior spread from Borders.

It&#x27;s a story that has stuck with her throughout her life. </p><p>She says she was shocked when asked to tackle the project — turning a 10-page story into a 200-page graphic novel — but calls it a &quot;dream project.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We got to play around with adding all of these landscape scenes and these lengthy interactions between the characters. Yeah, it was great,&quot; she said.</p><h2>&#x27;I feel safer on this side of the line&#x27;</h2><p>Despite being published 28 years ago, King says the story remains relevant today.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6014328">Thomas King publishing his first graphic novel — get a sneak peek now</a></li></ul></p><p>When some teammates crossed the border, they did identify as Blackfoot and sometimes officials waved them through with little trouble. That&#x27;s no longer true, he says.</p><p>And today, the writer says he avoids travel south of the border despite having relatives in the country.</p><p>&quot;I feel safer on this side of the line than I do on the other side of the line — for all sorts of reasons.&quot;</p><hr/><p><em>Written by Jason Vermes.
