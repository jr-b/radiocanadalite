That process will mean the intensive involvement of the conservator of her money, a role her father can&#x27;t be permitted to play, the filing says.</p><p>The flurry of major filings means that next week&#x27;s hearing could be pivotal.</p><h2>Future of conservatorship in question</h2><p>Judge Brenda Penny, who has remained largely neutral in her oversight of the case, will be pressed to decide whether to remove James Spears or to put the conservatorship on a path to termination.</p><p>James Spears stepped aside as conservator of his daughter&#x27;s person in 2019, maintaining only his role as conservator of her money.

Wednesday&#x27;s filing from Britney Spears says Montgomery also consents to ending the conservatorship,</p><p>Spears had said in a dramatic June 23 speech in court that gave a jolt to the case and galvanized support for her that she was being compelled under the conservatorship to take certain medications and to use an intrauterine device for birth control against her will.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | 80192950"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | 80192950</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Britney Spears&#x27; father James (Jamie) Spears, left, leaves the Los Angeles County Superior courthouse on March 10, 2008.
