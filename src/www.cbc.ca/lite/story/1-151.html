(Guelph Police Service)</p></div></div></p><h2>No large party in Waterloo</h2><p>Meanwhile in Waterloo, there was no massive party on Ezra Avenue as has been seen in years past during Homecoming weekend. That may be largely due to bright yellow fencing that lined the street, preventing people from gathering on the roadway.</p><p>Officials, including the region&#x27;s medical officer of health Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6188239">had encouraged students not to take part in large parties</a> to curb spread of COVID-19 and in particular, the highly transmissible delta variant. Wang has said previously that <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6147680">even people with both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine can still become sick</a> and can transmit the virus to other people.</p><p>Waterloo bylaw officers handed out about 19 tickets over the course of the weekend.</p><p>Preliminary numbers suggest there were 10 noise bylaw charges and one nuisance bylaw charge, a City of Waterloo spokesperson told CBC K-W in an email.</p><p>&quot;We were very pleased that was no unsanctioned street gathering, and that most students followed the gathering limits and city bylaws. For those that didn&#x27;t, charges were laid,&quot; said Nicole Papke, director, Municipal Enforcement Services, in an email. </p><p>&quot;We hope that the respect the students showed for our enforcement team and our community continues throughout the school year.&quot;</p><p>Earlier this month, city council implemented a <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6175124">special public nuisance bylaw from September 24 to 26</a>, coinciding with homecoming events. The temporary bylaw allowed officers to take action on any time of the day, rather than only in the evening. </p><p>There were also eight charges related to the Reopening Ontario Act, which covers gathering limits. The city said at least one of those charges was related to a party on Saturday.</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
