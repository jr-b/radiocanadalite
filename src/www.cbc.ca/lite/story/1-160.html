Her website says that &quot;Arielle&#x27;s story is one of breaking barriers, overcoming adversity, and defying expectations.

She&#x27;s a real go-getter, so if anybody can pull it off it&#x27;ll be her,&quot; he said, adding that Kayabaga is the first elected MP to be enrolled in the program.</p><p>Azzi said the program tends to appeal to political science grads who &quot;came away a little frustrated&quot; because their undergraduate studies turned out to be more theoretical than they&#x27;d anticipated.</p><p>&quot;So these are people who want to get their hands dirty actually working in politics,&quot; he said.</p><p>Azzi said when he surveys students in the program, about half of them say they&#x27;re interested in running for political office at some point in the future.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Stephen Azzi"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Stephen Azzi</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Stephen Azzi is director of the Clayton H. Riddell Graduate Program in Political Management at Carleton University.  (Submitted)</p></div></div></p><p>Might some professors find it a bit daunting to teach a student who&#x27;s already an MP? Maybe — but not necessarily, said Azzi.</p><p>&quot;We do get students who have a lot of experience, and frequently when I&#x27;m teaching a class I find there&#x27;s somebody in the room who knows more about the subject than I do. I&#x27;m always willing to turn it over to the expert in the room, and I&#x27;m sure this will happen with Arielle,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;When you teach political management and you&#x27;re teaching a bunch of political experts, you become humble very quickly.&quot;</p><h2>Lots to learn</h2><p>Azzi said students in the program learn the ins and outs of campaigning, polling and policy development, so there&#x27;s something new for everyone — even a sitting MP.</p><p>Last year, Azzi got a call from a senator on the verge of retirement who was interested in enrolling in the program after a career on Parliament Hill.</p><p>&quot;So even if you&#x27;re living and breathing it every day, you might not know everything,&quot; he said.</p><p>Launched in 2010, the Riddell Program is named after the late Clay Riddell, billionaire founder of Calgary-based petroleum company Paramount Resources Ltd., whose generous donation to Carleton made the program possible.</p><p>It&#x27;s normally an intensive 12-month program with a 10-week summer practicum for real-world work experience, but students have the option of taking evening courses over two or three years instead. Of the 50 or so students currently enrolled, about one-third are studying part-time, Azzi said.</p><p>Classes have been held online during the pandemic, but in-person learning is gradually resuming at Carleton.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Arielle Kayabaga - London West Liberal candidate"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Arielle Kayabaga - London West Liberal candidate</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Kayabaga said she&#x27;d be happy to mentor her classmates in the political management program if asked to do so.
