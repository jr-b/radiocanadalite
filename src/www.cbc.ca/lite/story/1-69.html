(Colin Hall/CBC)</p></div></div></p><p>&quot;Well, I saw the two Michaels yesterday. They&#x27;re in fine form,&quot; Garneau said. Other state-controlled media pieces from China praised the efforts of Chinese diplomats in the return of Meng Wanzhou and spoke positively about a possible restart of Canada-China relations.</p><p>From the perspective of the Canadian public, the events that led to the eventual return of Kovrig and Spavor unfolded quickly. Meng Wanzhou appeared virtually in a New York court Friday and it was announced that she had reached a deferred prosecution agreement relating to fraud charges laid against her by U.S. authorities.</p><p>She was then in a Vancouver courtroom, where her extradition case was dropped. She went directly to the airport and boarded a flight for China.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6189640">Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor arrive in Canada after nearly 3-year detention in China</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6189814">Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor are free: What does this mean for Canada-China relations?</a></li></ul></p><p>Soon after, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that Spavor and Kovrig were on a flight to Canada. The two men landed Saturday morning.</p><p>&quot;I think Canadians were very surprised. We&#x27;ve been working this in the background for a very long time,&quot; Garneau said. He told Barton he had heard about the deferred prosecution agreement several weeks ago and said that &quot;really was what opened the door to the return of the two Michaels.&quot;</p><p>It was certainly a surprise for Jacco Zwetsloot, a friend of Spavor&#x27;s. Zwetsloot said once he heard about the Wanzhou deal, he anticipated it might take six months for Spavor to be released. Then, he heard about Trudeau&#x27;s Friday announcement.</p><p>&quot;At that stage, everything just went wild. It was crazy,&quot; he said. </p><p><strong><em>Watch | Release of 2 Michaels linked to Meng Wanzhou plea deal, Ottawa says:</em></strong></p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Media Video | Kovrig, Spavor release linked to Meng Wanzhou plea deal, Ottawa says"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Media Video | Kovrig, Spavor release linked to Meng Wanzhou plea deal, Ottawa says</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: As Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor begin their transition to normal life after nearly three years of detention in China, the government has confirmed that Meng Wanzhou&#x27;s plea deal with U.S. prosecutors was key to their release — even though China continues to insist the two cases were not linked. </p></div></div></p><p>Zwetsloot met Spavor in Seoul, South Korea, and bonded over a mutual interest in North Korea. Spavor is an entrepreneur who has worked on organizing travel to North Korea.</p><p>Zwetsloot said he and friends missed Spavor and couldn&#x27;t wait to see him again: &quot;I have a bottle of North Korean snake liquor ready for when you come back to Seoul to see us again.&quot;</p><h2>&#x27;Very clear&#x27; link between cases: Garneau</h2><p>China has denied that there was any link between the cases of Meng Wanzhou and Kovrig and Spavor.</p><p>But the timing of the releases was noteworthy, he said. &quot;It&#x27;s very clear ... that the immediate return of the two Michaels linked that to the Meng Wanzhou case in a very direct manner,&quot; Garneau said.</p><p>The foreign affairs minister also said he didn&#x27;t think the timing of the two men&#x27;s return had anything to do with the timing of the federal election Monday: &quot;I think it just worked out that way.&quot;</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6188472">The Meng Wanzhou Huawei saga: A timeline</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6188244">CBC Radio&#x27;s The House: Kovrig, Spavor return home</a></li></ul></p><p>He also did not rule out the possibility of providing compensation to the two men.</p><p>&quot;We&#x27;re very sensitive to the fact that they&#x27;ve gone through an extraordinary ordeal in the past 1,019 days and that if there is any need for us to be there to support them, we will be there to support.&quot;</p><p>Garneau said the detention of the two Michaels had harmed China&#x27;s image internationally, as shown by growing support for an international declaration against arbitrary detention.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s fine for countries to have disagreements, but you cannot resort to arbitrarily putting citizens of another country in jail because you&#x27;re not happy with that country.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | CDA CHINA 20210924"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | CDA CHINA 20210924</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stands with Minister of Foreign Affairs Marc Garneau in Ottawa on Friday to announce that Canadians Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig had been released from detention in China.
