Starting in 2019, inductees received the Hall&#x27;s Order of Sport recognizing not only athletic achievement.</p><p>&quot;It goes without saying that we will always recognize incredible sports accomplishments,&quot; said Cheryl Bernard, the Hall&#x27;s chief executive officer. &quot;This class is not only about sports, it&#x27;s about community spirit.</p><blockquote class="pullquote">  <span class="pullquote-quotation">It&#x27;s really good to see lacrosse flourishing in our community of Six Nations, and in fact across Canada and North America</span>  <cite class="pullquote-source">— Mohawk lacrosse player and coach Ross Powless</cite> </blockquote><p>&quot;There&#x27;s a lot of people across this country still that don&#x27;t see what the value of sport is beyond Olympic medals or world championships, but if you can attach to those incredible accomplishments, the giveback, the social purpose, the role models and the ambassadors, all of a sudden sport resonates with all Canadians.&quot;</p><p>Barrett, who is autistic, won 13 gold powerlifting medals in the Special Olympics World Games.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.3177773">&#x27;Newfoundland Moose&#x27; wins 3 gold, 1 silver at Special Olympics World Games</a></li></ul></p><p>His induction is milestone recognition for the thousands of Special Olympians across Canada and millions worldwide, he said, &quot;who overcome numerous challenges and barriers, not just in sport, but in life. They go above and beyond to prove themselves.&quot;</p><p>Powless, from the Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation, Ont., was a standout lacrosse player who went on to coach players to success and organize leagues and tournaments. He died in 2003 at the age 76.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s really good to see lacrosse flourishing in our community of Six Nations, and in fact across Canada and North America, but Six Nations especially because we consider it the creator&#x27;s game, and coming from our culture, is doing so well,&quot; his son Richard Powless said.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5984215">Canadian Sports Hall of Famers showcased in Beyond the Win series</a></li></ul></p><p>Gaudet, a three-time Paralympic gold medallist in curling, and Campbell, who is considered &quot;the father of wheelchair rugby&quot; say while Canada has made strides in sport for the differently abled, there is still work to be done.</p><p>&quot;The changes are being visibly seen now,&quot; Campbell said. &quot;Our game I don&#x27;t even think would exist if we didn&#x27;t have in Canada a really inclusive attitude.</p><p>&quot;We started our game in 1976.
