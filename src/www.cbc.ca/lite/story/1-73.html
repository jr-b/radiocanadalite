Is it a competition? We don&#x27;t have all of the information, but obviously, seeing as though the province of Ontario is still in Stage 3, we can&#x27;t do normal business, and our rent still has to get paid and electricity and gas.

Applications for the program open on Oct. 13.</p><h2>&#x27;This is badly needed&#x27;</h2><p>According to Cohen, Lee&#x27;s Palace is running at a loss of about 90 per cent of eligible revenue from pre-pandemic levels, while the Horseshoe Tavern, because it has a front bar and outside front patio, has a loss more in the 80 per cent range. He said Lee&#x27;s Palace, a money-making business, was &quot;devastated&quot; by the pandemic. </p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s crazy,&quot; he said. &quot;This is badly needed.&quot;</p><p>Andrew Weir, executive vice-president of Destination Toronto, an organization that markets Toronto to world travellers, agreed that the money is welcome.</p><p>&quot;This is very important funding that will certainly help a lot of businesses get to the next stage. It doesn&#x27;t solve all the problems. It doesn&#x27;t take us to very end. And I think the minister knows this,&quot; Weir said.</p><p>&quot;She&#x27;s been working very closely with the industry and listening a lot to what the businesses have been telling her and we see that reflected in the kind of policy announcement today.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Mount Baldy "><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Mount Baldy </p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: A groomer pushes a mound of artificial snow near the magic carpet at Mount Baldy Ski Area in Thunder Bay, Ont.

About $160 million was lost in revenue in the sector.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s great news today. We&#x27;re happy to be receiving some support from the provincial government. It&#x27;s a good way to start the week,&quot; said Nichol, whose organization represents alpine and cross country operators across the province.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s been a tough, tough hit, but we&#x27;re looking forward to a brighter season ahead.&quot;</p><p>As for the Mirvish Productions, it laid off 500 employees when the pandemic hit. It&#x27;s set to reopen in early December with a production of<em> Jesus Christ Superstar </em>for the holiday season.</p><p>&quot;We may, in our very early performances, all be wearing masks. But I know that we&#x27;re going to celebrate having our freedom once more and being able to be at work once more and be employed,&quot; David Mirvish said.</p><p>Those receiving funds through the program can apply the money to staff salaries, health and safety measures for workers and visitors, and marketing expenses. </p><p>&quot;Program funding will help successful applicants prepare to reopen safely, develop innovative tourism products, retain and create tourism jobs, and support tourism recovery in their region and throughout Ontario,&quot; the government said in the release.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | HEATRE Mirvish Productions Cancelled 20200314"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | HEATRE Mirvish Productions Cancelled 20200314</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: David Mirvish of Mirvish Productions says: &#x27;We may, in our very early performances, all be wearing masks.
