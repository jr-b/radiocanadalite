Until then, Mr. Melanson will not be commenting on the matter.&quot;</p><p>Coon is also undecided and said he&#x27;s waiting to hear back from government officials on whether more of the information presented to the committee will be publicly available.</p><p>&quot;There&#x27;s so much that&#x27;s discussed in the COVID cabinet committee that should be presented to New Brunswickers,&quot; he said.</p><h2>Committee remnant of minority era</h2><p>Higgs invited the other three party leaders to join the ad hoc committee in the early days of the pandemic in March 2020, when he did not have a majority government.</p><p>While the Progressive Conservative cabinet remained the final decision-making authority for COVID-19 measures under the provincial state of emergency, the all-party committee was able to get briefings and provide some oversight.</p><p>But the other party leaders were sometimes in a bind when decisions were controversial, because joining the committee involved taking an oath of cabinet confidentiality, just like regular ministers do.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | party leaders"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | party leaders</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: The COVID cabinet committee originated during the early days of the pandemic, when Premier Blaine Higgs only had a minority government and Kevin Vickers was still Liberal leader.

Lewis of the University of New Brunswick in Saint John. &quot;So it is a bit of a turn if you say, &#x27;We&#x27;re going to go back.&#x27;&quot; </p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Kris Austin, People&#x27;s Alliance"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Kris Austin, People&#x27;s Alliance</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: People’s Alliance Leader Kris Austin said he will rejoin the COVID committee.
