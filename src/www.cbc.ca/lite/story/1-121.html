Family is the people who are there for you,&quot; Lavallee told CBC Edmonton&#x27;s Radio Active.</p><p>&quot;You know, blood through blood, sweat and tears every single day of your life.

It&#x27;s really no different than children with divorced parents, Lavallee said. </p><p>&quot;The film really dives deep into how we kind of all work together to resolve all that,&quot; he said. </p><h2>Family ties</h2><p>The concept of adopting a family is normal for Lavallee, whose perspective is formed both by being an adopted child and also in his broader definition of family ties.</p><p>He&#x27;s always had people in his life that he considers family, even if he&#x27;s not related to them — such as Jazmin Ferdinandi, the daughter of Lavallee&#x27;s best friend who died. </p><p>&quot;We&#x27;re actually not related by blood at all. But she&#x27;s always been my niece and I&#x27;ve always been Uncle Guy ever since she was born,&quot; he said. </p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5818646">&#x27;Such a surprise&#x27;: Edmonton filmmaker awarded Order of Canada</a></li></ul></p><p>Lavallee hadn&#x27;t planned to tell the story of his family. The idea sprung up in conversation with a friend and director.</p><p>&quot;She was kind of the one that sparked the idea,&quot; he said. </p><p>Lavallee&#x27;s film includes interviews with his relatives and friends, in which they discuss topics like pregnancy, adoption and family. </p><p>He hopes the film redefines a perfect family to be a group of people who love and support each other. </p><p>&quot;We&#x27;re all just trying to do what&#x27;s best for the kids,&quot; he said. </p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
