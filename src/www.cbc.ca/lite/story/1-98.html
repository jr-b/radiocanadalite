(Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)</p></div></div></div><div><p>Mining giant Rio Tinto and Unifor Local 2301 have reached a tentative agreement on a new contract, potentially ending a two-month long strike that impacted the B.C. North Coast economy throughout the summer.</p><p>&quot;Both parties are satisfied that the proposed agreement will provide a foundation for respect in the workplace and underpin a competitive and sustainable future for B.C. Works, benefiting employees and their families, the company, and the broader community,&quot; Rio Tinto and the union announced in a <a href="https://www.riotinto.com/news/releases/2021/Agreement-in-principle-reached-by-Rio-Tinto-and-Unifor-Local-2301">joint statement<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> released Sept. 25, 2021.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6116615">Rio Tinto smelter workers go on strike in Kitimat, B.C.</a></li></ul></p><p>Some 950 smelter and hydroelectric plant workers will vote on the deal in the coming days.  Ratification of the proposed collective agreement will end a bitter two-month long strike at Rio Tinto&#x27;s B.C. Works operations.</p><p>According to the statement, both parties have also reached an agreement for a memorandum of understanding on a new way of working together and on a return-to-work protocol.</p><p>They have agreed to not publish details on the proposed agreement until Unifor 2301 has completed the ratification process.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6130157">Rio Tinto hasn&#x27;t returned to bargaining table after a week of labour conflict in B.C.</a></li></ul></p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6153147">Negotiations resume to end month-long Kitimat smelter strike</a></li></ul></p><p>The strike began at the Kitimat smelter on July 25, after talks broke off when the parties failed to reach agreement on resolving hundreds of outstanding grievances and a new process to resolve disputes.</p><p>The previous collective agreement expired earlier this year. </p><p>The smelter continued to operate, under an essential services order granted by the B.C. Labour Relations Board, at 25 per cent capacity of its normal 432,000 tonne annual capacity.</p><h2>Kitimat welcomes deal</h2><p>&quot;Oh, it&#x27;s absolutely massive,&quot; said Kitimat Mayor Phil Germuth in response to the announcement of the agreement.</p><p>&quot;There hasn&#x27;t been a more stable job supporter, income supporter, in the whole history of Kitimat. Let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s the whole reason we exist,&quot; he told <em>CBC News</em>. </p><p>Some local businesses reported a 30 per cent drop in sales as the strike dragged on through the summer, and some sub-contractors shifted work to the region&#x27;s LNG Canada project. </p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6146872">Kitimat businesses worried as Rio Tinto strike drags on</a></li></ul></p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6107901">B.C. First Nation and partners propose new $10B LNG megaproject</a></li></ul></p><p>&quot;Every single business has felt an impact of the strike,&quot; Germuth said, noting the economic impact could be felt through the North Coast. </p><p>&quot;The community is happy about [the agreement]. We&#x27;re happy about it. No doubt the workers will be happy, the contractors, and of course, lets not forget about Rio Tinto.  Aluminum is at a much higher price than it has been for over a decade now and it&#x27;s good for them too to get back to producing aluminum,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;There&#x27;s definitely that feeling in the town of elation that soon this is over and we can start to get back to normal.&quot;</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
