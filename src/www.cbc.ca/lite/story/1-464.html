Do you vote in order to get a &quot;friendly&quot; government that will support First Nations to attain a better quality of life? Or do you not vote because it will erode our sovereignty, nationhood and identity? </p><p>When I was younger, I wanted to cast my ballot as soon as I turned 18.

But just because Canada is not holding up its end of the deal doesn&#x27;t mean we should also renege on our side. More importantly, participating in these elections grants power to Canada because we&#x27;re tacitly giving it decision-making authority over First Nations lives.  </p><p>Others argue that <a href="https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/indigenous-suffrage"><u>First Nations only got the right to vote in 1960</u><img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a>, so we should take full advantage after having been excluded from the Canadian political process for so long. </p><p>It feels almost insidious as though the government had recast its assimilationist policy in the form of integration. Hence voting can be considered a continuation of colonization. </p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | advance poll 2021 federal election canada vote sign gatineau"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | advance poll 2021 federal election canada vote sign gatineau</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Canadians will head to the polls on Sept. 20 for the federal election.  (Francis Ferland/CBC)</p></div></div></p><p>There are several ongoing campaigns to <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.3266798"><u>boost Indigenous turnout</u></a> including &#x27;rock the vote&#x27; among First Nations, and you can see the impact on parliament. In 2015, Indigenous voters helped put Justin Trudeau and the Liberals into power with <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6153614"><u>a record turnout — 61.5 per cent of people living on reserves cast ballots</u></a>.</p><p>And yet, it seems things haven&#x27;t turned out much better. Development continues to infringe on land rights and title, MMIWG promises remain stagnant, and other sectors in Indigenous policy are dissatisfied with the Liberal performance. </p><p>Those who disagree with me might say that First Nations should vote to influence who our partner is across the table. Perhaps an NDP government might be different or the Green Party. </p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6178086">As an Indigenous Sovereigntist, I will vote in this year&#x27;s federal election</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6175738">First Nations vote a potential &#x27;kingmaker&#x27; in federal election outcomes for northern Ontario</a></li></ul></p><p>But that&#x27;s not the point. It seems First Nations are so worried about looking for recognition and support from Canada that we forget we do not need it as much as we think.</p><p>Everything we need is within ourselves, particularly our traditional governance structures. </p><p>While it is important that Canada lives up to its treaty obligations and agreements, it&#x27;s more important that we hold Canada accountable<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5413265"><u> through the courts and legal system</u></a> as a partner than as a participant because one acknowledges our inherent nationhood and the other diminishes it. </p><p>As a citizen of the Anishinaabe Nation, I have never voted nor ever will in any Canadian institutional election, but I will continue to participate in my home nation of Wauzhushk Onigum&#x27;s customary election. </p><p>This is a complex issue and I encourage all First Nations people to consider where they are coming from and to look ahead at where they are going. I have decided to honour and respect my obligations as a spiritual being to the relationship we have formed with another nation and the responsibilities that come with that. Most importantly, I want to ensure that the future generation never forgets that they are a nation. </p><hr/><p><em><strong>Do you have a compelling personal story that can bring understanding or help others?
