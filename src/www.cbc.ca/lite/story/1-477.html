A client would purport to give away their wealth to one of the shell companies and then get back regular tax-free &quot;gifts&quot; from income earned when the money was invested abroad.</p><p>Through their lawyer, the Cooper family declined to comment. </p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | APTOPIX Britain Weather"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | APTOPIX Britain Weather</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Beachgoers walk along a tidal causeway in the Isle of Man.

(Raphael Satter/The Associated Press)</p></div></div></p><p>In 2015, Marshall Cooper said KPMG approached his family to sign up for the tax dodge, and that questions should be directed towards the accounting firm.</p><p>The scheme involved at least 25 well-heeled Canadians.   </p><p>The Coopers are &quot;just the tip of the iceberg,&quot; said Dennis Howlett, the former head of Canadians for Tax Fairness, a group that advocates against offshore tax secrecy.</p><p>The House of Commons<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6031057"> <u>finance committee rebooted</u></a> a long-dormant probe into Isle of Man shell companies last month after<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5998374"> <u>CBC/Radio-Canada reported on</u></a> suspicious money transfers unrelated to the Coopers.</p><p>During hearings into the KPMG Isle of Man companies back in 2016, the Liberal chair of the finance committee abruptly blocked testimony — before MPs were able to know how much money the government might have lost in revenue or the names of all the KPMG clients behind those shell companies.</p><h2>Lifestyle &#x27;not supported by the income he reported&#x27;</h2><p>In the case of Peter Cooper, who died in 2016, documents filed in Federal Court and Tax Court state he had access to a fortune of more than $25 million offshore and owned a $4-million mansion across the street from the Royal Victoria Yacht Club.</p><p>Yet the CRA says in court filings that he paid little or no income tax between 1999 and 2010.</p><p>In 2001, Cooper received a $250 cheque from a federal government program to help low-income Canadians with home heating costs. The documents state that every year from 1999 to 2010, both he and his wife claimed and received GST rebate payments — a tax credit for individuals and families with low or modest incomes.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6031057">MPs braced for battle with global accounting firm over naming wealthy Canadians behind offshore tax shelters</a></li></ul></p><p>His sons also benefited from government tax credits, court records show. Richard Cooper claimed a $9,000 home renovation tax credit in 2009 and Marshall Cooper paid $3,049 in total income taxes between 2002 and 2011, while receiving tax credits worth $5,420 over the same period.</p><p>At the same time, the Coopers were secretly receiving what added up to millions of dollars in what KPMG had called tax free &quot;gifts&quot; from their offshore investments from their family fortune. </p><p>At some point, the CRA observed that Peter Cooper&#x27;s &quot;lifestyle was not supported by the income he reported,&quot; the agency says in its court filings.</p><h2><strong>Deception &#x27;part of the plan&#x27;</strong></h2><p>It all seemed to come to an abrupt end for KPMG and the Coopers when CRA auditors discovered the confidential Isle of Man scheme in 2010.</p><p>In 2012, aside from having to pay back taxes and interest, the Coopers were assessed nearly $4 million in penalties for what the CRA termed &quot;gross negligence.&quot; The agency stated the KPMG scheme was a &quot;sham&quot; and that &quot;deception was part of the plan&quot; to not declare income in Canada and instead label the money as tax-free gifts.</p><p>But despite the CRA unearthing the KPMG offshore scheme, the Cooper family continued to use it for several years without tax officials realizing, the documents filed in Federal Court show. </p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | KPMG Vancouver "><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | KPMG Vancouver </p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: KPMG said in a statement that its Isle of Man tax plan &#x27;fully complied with all applicable tax laws.&#x27;  (CBC)</p></div></div></p><p>&quot;The expectation was they remain in compliance after the 2012 reassessments; however, by their own assertions, they chose not to do so,&quot; the CRA said in the court filings.</p><p>The court documents show that the Cooper family eventually admitted in late 2015 — after dropping KPMG&#x27;s in-house lawyer as their legal counsel — that they continued to fail to report hundreds of thousands of dollars in investment income from the Isle of Man between 2011 and 2014.</p><p>&quot;I am not surprised,&quot; Howlett said. &quot;The rich can play that game…. It is how far can you skate over the line and not get caught.&quot;</p><h2>Cooper family sought amnesty from penalties</h2><p>Court documents show the Coopers made their admission to the CRA hoping to qualify for what is known as the Voluntary Disclosure Programme or VDP. The program was set up by the CRA to provide amnesty for those who come forward on their own volition, declare previously unreported income and agree to pay back taxes.</p><p>The documents show the CRA rejected the Cooper family&#x27;s VDP application, stating there was nothing voluntary about it since they were under audit for the Isle of Man scheme for the tax years 2002 to 2010.</p><p>The Coopers appealed the CRA&#x27;s decision in court but eventually withdrew that action, focusing instead on a challenge to the tax agency&#x27;s decision to impose $4 million in gross negligence penalties for their undeclared income prior to 2010.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Dennis Howlett"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Dennis Howlett</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Dennis Howlett, former head of Canadians for Tax Fairness, says the latest revelations about KPMG&#x27;s tax scheme show rich people playing a game of &#x27;how far can you skate over the line and not get caught.&#x27;  (CBC)</p></div></div></p><p>Eventually the CRA agreed to a secret<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5154610"> <u>out-of-court settlement with the Coopers</u></a> in 2019.

KPMG also said that the CRA settles the &quot;vast majority&quot; of tax cases out of court.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Greg Wiebe, KPMG head of tax"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Greg Wiebe, KPMG head of tax</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: KPMG tax partner Greg Wiebe testified in front of the Commons finance committee in 2016.
