He went on to kill nine more people — acquaintances and people he encountered while travelling nearly 200 kilometres in a vehicle outfitted to look like a cruiser. </p><h2>Findings not public yet</h2><p>While some residents dropped in to the open house in Truro with questions about what the inquiry has uncovered, staff did not discuss their findings, only the steps they were taking.  </p><p>MacLean said summaries of the evidence gathered so far will be shared during public hearings, which are scheduled to start Oct. 26 at the Convention Centre in Halifax. </p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6170143">Nova Scotia&#x27;s mass shooting inquiry has submitted subpoenas to the RCMP: spokesperson</a></li></ul></p><p>&quot;We&#x27;re summarizing that information in what we&#x27;re calling a foundational document, as well as citing the sources of the information that gives us that summary that will be shared with participants.

Its mandate includes examining how police and government agencies responded as well as issuing ranging from access to firearms to gender-based violence. </p><p>MacLean pointed out that recommendations won&#x27;t be legally binding, so it&#x27;s crucial for the public to support the findings and push for changes.</p><p>&quot;Post November of 2022, we will need community members, community leaders to champion the changes that we identify collectively to enhance public safety in our communities,&quot; she said. </p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6152609">Inquiry into N.S. shootings welcomes input &#x27;so we get to the best answer&#x27;</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6066195">False sightings, reports of gunfire: Court documents reveal details of RCMP response in Portapique</a></li></ul></p><p>Wayne Smith, a welder and artist from Salmon River, N.S., said he dropped by to better understand what the commission was doing and to ask questions about grief counselling.
