They&#x27;re bracing for more of that type of attitude.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6178203">Why vaccine passports may be an important tool in boosting vaccination rates</a></li></ul></p><p>To help protect staff, the restaurant installed a bell near the front till that rings directly to the kitchen, so that employees can call for extra help if there&#x27;s a conflict.</p><p>&quot;Our issue right now is mainly the safety of our front-line staff. We want them to feel supported and we want them to feel safe in their workspace,&quot; Miles said.</p><h2>Inspections and fines</h2><p>In response to those concerns, a spokesperson for the Ontario health minister said bylaw officers are responsible for enforcing the new requirements and inspectors will be visiting establishments to offer help and support to staff. </p><p>Workers in Ontario are being asked to call 911 if they feel threatened for denying entry to someone who refuses to comply. </p><p>In Quebec, people who try to get into places requiring a vaccination passport without one risk receiving fines ranging from $1,000 to $6,000.

She hopes the process will get smoother with time.</p><h2>Extra anxiety</h2><p>It all comes down to employees being put in an unfair position that they never signed up for, according to Toronto-based employment lawyer Muneeza Sheikh.</p><p>&quot;What we are doing, essentially, is we&#x27;re placing employees in a combative scenario when that isn&#x27;t part of their job duty,&quot; she said.</p><p>Sheikh said some of her clients have hired new staff altogether — if they can afford it — to enforce vaccine mandates. But for establishments that don&#x27;t have or can&#x27;t afford security, she said the vaccine requirements put them in a difficult position.</p><p>&quot;There are Canadian employees who have a significant amount of anxiety around going to work now around this vaccination passport and how it&#x27;s going to be implemented,&quot; she said.</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
