But even so, she already had a strong individuality and also a strong will. She already knew what she wants and doesn&#x27;t want.&quot; </p><p>Koelbl, now in her 80s, was starting a project to document the impact of power on people over time. She would continue to photograph Merkel, who&#x27;s stepping down as German chancellor, on and off over the next 30 years.  </p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Angela Merkel"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Angela Merkel</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: German photographer Herlinde Koelbl photographed Merkel on and off for three decades, including in 1991, left, and 2008.

(Jesco Denzel/Bundesregierung via Getty Images)</p></div></div></p><p>&quot;If you want an ingredient of her success, it has been that she&#x27;s a very guarded person,&quot; said Klaus Goetz, a specialist in European politics at Munich&#x27;s Ludwig Maximilian University.  </p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s very rare that anything slips out. And she&#x27;s not like Boris Johnson or some very sort of impulsive people. She&#x27;s very controlled. She&#x27;s controlling and controlled.&quot; </p><h2>&#x27;There is no secret&#x27;</h2><p>&quot;The only secret is that there is no secret,&quot; said Ralph Bollmann, author of a recently published Merkel biography called <em>The Chancellor and her Time</em>.  </p><p>&quot;She is like she is. And I think only people who have in mind an image of a macho style, a traditional politician&#x27;s politician, are wondering if there is something [else behind it].&quot; </p><p>Bollmann&#x27;s theory is that Merkel learned to keep her own counsel as a young girl, growing up in former East Germany as the daughter of a Lutheran minister. </p><p>&quot;As a pastor&#x27;s daughter in a communist regime and afterwards as a woman, and as an East German in Western [male-dominated] politics, she always had a good sense of resistance, of not ceding.&quot; </p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Photogallery  | Angela Merkel: A retrospective in photos of the German chancellor&#x27;s political life"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Photogallery  | Angela Merkel: A retrospective in photos of the German chancellor&#x27;s political life</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Germany&#x27;s centre-left Social Democrats won the biggest share of the vote in a national election Sunday, narrowly beating outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel&#x27;s centre-right Union bloc in a closely fought race that will determine who succeeds the longtime leader at the helm of Europe&#x27;s biggest economy. </p></div></div></p><p>Merkel studied quantum chemistry at the University of Leipzig before moving to East Berlin for work. She was there when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989.   </p><p>&quot;In politics, there are very often situations where there is only the alternative to go out or go up,&quot; said Bollman. &quot;She didn&#x27;t want to go out.&quot;  </p><p>Only two other German leaders have served longer in office than Merkel: Prince Otto von Bismarck and Kohl.</p><p>Goetz said Merkel stands up poorly when placed against leaders like Kohl, calling her a manager and the latter a visionary. </p><h2>Seeking compromise</h2><p>&quot;Under Helmut Kohl, we had the Maastricht Treaty with the introduction of the euro. We had the opening to central and eastern Europe. We had German unification.&quot;</p><p>Merkel&#x27;s advocates say it is her skill as a manager that has defined her premiership: an ability to seek compromise into the wee hours and present a steady hand at the helm during times of crisis.  </p><p>In 2015, when hundreds of thousands of mainly Syrian refugees arrived in Europe, Merkel was criticized for leaving Germany&#x27;s border open. Her response to worried Germans was &quot;we can manage.&quot; </p><p>Syrians now settled in Germany call her the &quot;mother of refugees.&quot; </p><p><em><strong>WATCH | The legacy of Angela Merkel:</strong></em></p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Media Video | The legacy of German Chancellor Angela Merkel"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Media Video | The legacy of German Chancellor Angela Merkel</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: After 16 years as German chancellor, Angela Merkel doesn’t leave behind a legacy of change or innovation, but one of managing the situations at hand. </p></div></div></p><p>But the turmoil of their arrival also provoked anti-immigrant groups and it was on her watch that a far-right party was elected to the German parliament for the first time since the end of the Second World War.  </p><p>Bollmann believes her motives were both personal and pragmatic. </p><p>&quot;She was a citizen of the former communist eastern Germany. She didn&#x27;t want to build new walls in Europe. And she wanted Germany as an open society, as a liberal society to preserve liberalism against populist uprisings.&quot;  </p><p>Now that Merkel is leaving, the political autopsy on her tenure has begun, one line of criticism being that she has failed to &quot;future-proof&quot; Germany or to leave a vision of where the country should be headed.  </p><h2>A popularity boost<strong> </strong></h2><p>&quot;I think she&#x27;s been a stabilizing force there, but she&#x27;s definitely not been innovative in any way,&quot; said Travis Todd, a dual U.S.-German citizen who runs a campus for start-ups in Berlin.  </p><p>COVID-19 gave Merkel another crisis to handle, and another boost in popularity.
