And the only people who&#x27;re going to suffer are people who need overdraft because their CERB doesn&#x27;t cover their pay or their rent and their heating and their food.&quot;</p><p>Other frustrated TD customers reached out to Go Public, too.</p><p>&quot;It seems corporately immoral … given the economic ramifications of the pandemic,&quot; wrote one customer who said he is on fixed income disability benefit.</p><p>&quot;People are struggling,&quot; wrote another. &quot;I&#x27;m just shocked.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Kisan Gunjal "><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Kisan Gunjal </p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Economist and longtime BMO customer Kisan Gunjal complained to the bank&#x27;s ombudsman about its recent fee increases.

All of the big five continued to make billions in profits in 2020, but their reported net incomes were down from 2019, before the pandemic, for all but TD.</p><p>It all fuels the need for more oversight, according to Conacher, the banking critic. His organization has collected almost 80,000 signatures on a petition urging Ottawa to make the banks do more to help Canadians during the pandemic.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Embed  | First quarter profits at Canada&#x27;s 5 biggest banks"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Embed  | First quarter profits at Canada&#x27;s 5 biggest banks</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY"> </p></div></div></p><p>&quot;Banking is ... as essential as heating and electricity in terms of living in today&#x27;s society,&quot; he said. &quot;And the government should be regulating like it&#x27;s an essential service. Which means ensure they serve everyone fairly … and that gouging is prohibited.&quot;</p><p>He points out that even though Canada&#x27;s big banks are much smaller than many banks in other countries, four still ranked among the top 50 most profitable in the world in 2020.</p><p>Conacher is calling on Ottawa to change the Bank Act, to require independent audits of every division of the banks to determine their profit margins. &quot;And if it&#x27;s more than a reasonable profit margin of 10 to 15 per cent, then the banks should be forced to lower their fees and interest rates to a reasonable level,&quot; he says.</p><p>Democracy Watch has called on the government to more closely monitor the banks&#x27; profits before, but hasn&#x27;t seen any action. </p><p>&quot;The banks can look back and see that finance minister after finance minister has protected the gouging ... that banks do to millions of Canadians,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;m just guessing that they think current Finance Minister [Chrystia] Freeland and Prime Minister Trudeau will continue to do the same — roll over and do nothing.&quot;</p><p>Changing the act could take years. In the meantime, the finance minister could speak to the banks, says Ken Whitehurst, executive director of the Consumers Council of Canada.</p><p>&quot;The minister might wave her stick in the form of leading a national conversation ... and see if the banks would choose to ease up,&quot; he said.</p><p>Go Public asked the ministry what it&#x27;s prepared to do about fee increases.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6029875">TD Bank accused of losing customers&#x27; RSPs — again</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5917139">Woman loses $340K in wire transfer scam — alleges 4 banks did little to stop it</a></li></ul></p><p>A spokesperson for the finance minister said she couldn&#x27;t provide a response.
