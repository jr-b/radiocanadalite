insensitive&quot; clothing for their graduation photos.</p><p>Stephanie Underhill Tomilson said Monday started out as expected, with students dressed up to have their photos taken.</p><p>Some were dressed in white shirts and jeans or overalls, which Underhill Tomilson said didn&#x27;t faze her.</p><p>As the day went on, however, Underhill Tomilson said some of the students began to &quot;embellish&quot; those outfits by adding jewelry, bandanas and do-rags.</p><p>By the afternoon, Underhill Tomilson had sent a letter home to students and parents to address what she said was &quot;an inappropriate and culturally insensitive photo initiative by some [members] of our graduating class.&quot;</p><p>&quot;While the initiative was not sanctioned by nor endorsed by the school, it reflects poorly on all of us,&quot; Underhill Tomilson said in the letter.</p><p>&quot;In the upcoming days, we will be working as a graduating class on how to make this right. All graduates with questionable school photos have been deleted by Harvey Studios and will have them retaken tomorrow.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | students"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | students</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Photos shared online show students dressed in white shirts and overalls, with bandanas, jewellery and hairstyles emulating dreadlocks.

As the principal of the school I am committed to move the school forward in a more welcoming manner.&quot;</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.5833320">Oromocto students walk out of classes to protest &#x27;daily&#x27; acts of racism</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.4619855">&#x27;It&#x27;s a symbol of racism&#x27;: Oromocto family stung by presence, defence of Confederate flag at school</a></li></ul></p><p>Speaking to CBC&#x27;s Harry Forestell on Tuesday, Underhill Tomilson said she&#x27;s explained to the students that the shirt and overalls on their own weren&#x27;t the issue.</p><p>&quot;But when you start adding jewellery and you take a bandana and you put it on your head or you add a do-rag, you are now creating a costume out of a culture and we just can&#x27;t go there,&quot; she said.</p><p>Thandiwe McCarthy, a seventh-generation Black Canadian who grew up in Fredericton, said he was forwarded photos taken of those students by a Black friend of his who graduated from Fredericton High School just a few years ago.</p><p>He said the outfits he saw students wearing, along with some who had their hair twisted to imitate dreadlocks, represented &quot;a toxic stereotype&quot; of Black culture.</p><p><strong><em>WATCH | Fredericton High School principal Stephanie Tomlinson addresses incident</em></strong></p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Media Video | Fredericton students wear &#x27;culturally-insensitive&#x27; attire for graduation photo day"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Media Video | Fredericton students wear &#x27;culturally-insensitive&#x27; attire for graduation photo day</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Fredericton High School principal Stephanie Tomlinson addresses an incident on Monday where students dressed in attire that offended other community members for being culturally insensitive.
