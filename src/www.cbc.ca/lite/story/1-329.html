The company says a user can get their cholesterol level, for example, on their smartphone in as little as 15 minutes.</p><p>Victoria Coleman, Verv&#x27;s vice-president of business development, said the company&#x27;s &quot;secret sauce&quot; is patent-pending technology that can separate blood plasma from whole blood in a small device.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s looking to transform how people can take their blood and they&#x27;ll take their blood from their homes,&quot; Coleman said. &quot;So it will enable individuals to be able to do their own blood testing from their home and have results within 15 minutes to their smartphone.&quot;</p><p>Earlier this month Verv received a $500,000 grant from the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation to develop and commercialize its technology.</p><p>Coleman said the company expects to complete its prototype in October, and have it available to consumers in 2022.</p><p>Once the technology is available, Verv will sell disposable chips for between $50 and $90, that collect a few pinpricks of blood. The chip is inserted in a $399 analyzer that will separate the plasma from whole blood and send the results to the user&#x27;s phone.</p><p>&quot;We can test for many things that are commonly desired by the consumer,&quot; Coleman said. &quot;Things such as your cholesterol and your vitamin D, your thyroid hormones. You could test inflammatory markers.&quot;</p><h2>Blood-testing technology advances</h2><p>While such tests can be done at a lab, Coleman said more people want to manage their health from home.
