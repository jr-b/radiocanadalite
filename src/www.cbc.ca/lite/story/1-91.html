But it does make a difference in the environment of the unit in the sense that you can come to work and you can try your best to make a difference in your co-workers&#x27; lives as well as in your patients&#x27; lives,&quot; Reeves said.</p><h2>&#x27;I just want to get in there and help out&#x27;</h2><p>Amanda Durrant, also a third-year nursing student at UNBC, says the pandemic has reaffirmed her career goals. </p><p>&quot;I just want to get over this pandemic and hopefully we can move on with our lives, but we can&#x27;t do that until, you know [until] the majority of people are comfortable getting the COVID vaccine,&quot; said Durrant, who also worked as a student nurse last summer and plans to do the same next year.</p><p>&quot;I just want to get in there and help out.

Durrant wants to provide people with accurate information — something she says she wasn&#x27;t given when she needed it. </p><p>&quot;I went into nursing to be able to be that advocate for parents and people who are unsure about vaccines,&quot; Durrant said.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s a very complex science, and I find that people are just making these decisions based on an emotional stance. And it&#x27;s scary for a lot of people.
