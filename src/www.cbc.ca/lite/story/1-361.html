Auxiliary police patrol parks on a seasonal basis, and are jointly funded by police and the city&#x27;s parks department.</p><p>&quot;During the spring, summer and early fall that park is patrolled almost seven days a week,&quot; said Dilkens.</p><p>Nearly $1 million is being used to install lighting across 14 parks in the city. The money is being funnelled through city council, ward funds and CUPE Local 82. Some projects, such as Forest Glade, have already been completed, while others will be finished next year.</p><p>Here&#x27;s a list of city parks where lighting will be installed or replaced:</p><ul>   <li>Remington: 30 solar lights.</li>   <li>Walker Homesite: 15 solar lights.</li>   <li>Forest Glade: 26 traditional LED lights.</li>   <li>Langlois/Southdale: 6 solar lights and 34 traditional LED lights.</li>   <li>Bridgeview: 9 traditional LED lights.</li>   <li>Riverfront: 27 traditional LED lights.</li>   <li>Bellewood: 7 traditional LED lights.</li>   <li>Optimist Memorial: 5 solar lights.</li>   <li>Maple Leaf: 12 solar lights.</li>   <li>Esdras: 3 solar lights.</li>   <li>Shawnee: 1 solar light.</li>   <li>Tranby: 11 traditional LED lights.</li>   <li>Riverside Baseball Park: 7 traditional LED lights.</li>  </ul></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
