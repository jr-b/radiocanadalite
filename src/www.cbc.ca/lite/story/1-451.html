(Submitted by Promod Puri)</p></div></div></p><p>Things went on smoothly at the store — the customers were friendly, and the good-natured manager was helpful.</p><p>After a few weeks of working at the convenience store, my manager, in a cordial tone, asked me, &quot;If you don&#x27;t mind, can I call you Peter?&quot; as my first name was &quot;a little hard to pronounce.&quot;</p><p>My instant response was, &quot;no problem.&quot;</p><p>The name change was like a pat on my back from regular customers and the rest of the employees.</p><p>Still, I was not quite ready to accept the new moniker on top of my parent-given appellation.</p><p>I felt something like losing a fraction of my Indian identity within me. The inner voice also told me, &quot;to gain something, you have to lose something.&quot;</p><h2>Name change common in South Asian communities</h2><p>Soon I found out the name change was quite common within the South Asian communities. They often switched their first names: for example, from Mohinder to Mo, Amrit to Amy, Rajinder to Roger, Davinder to Dave, Harjit to Harry, Maninder or Manjit to Mary, Ashok to Ash, and so on.</p><p>At the 7-Eleven, my name change got a further adjustment when the manager, followed by other staff, started calling me &quot;Pete.&quot;</p><p>But for me, the transformation from Promod to Peter and then Pete was tolerable. Peter/Pete was not a big deal.</p><p>It might not be a big deal for me. Still, the adoption of aliases was a favoured topic for argument among<strong> </strong>most South Asian immigrants at our social get-togethers.</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.4013531">Every name is a &#x27;Canadian name&#x27;</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6016386">How I learned to reclaim my Hindi name</a></li></ul></p><p>The community was divided between the professionals, like academics, doctors or engineers, with secure jobs, and the rest of the folks in manual, sales, or other employment.</p><p>Whereas the professionals stuck to their first names no matter how hard to pronounce, the rest, like me, did not mind being called Peter, Pete, Mike, or Mo.   </p><p>My experience at the 7-Eleven was quite pleasant and gratifying altogether, meeting customers and enthusiastically handling money — a first in my life.</p><p>My uniform over my shirt was the jacket with a printed 7-Eleven logo all over the fabric. Besides keeping me warm, the outfit reminded me of those cotton shawls or a piece of oblong cloth wrapped by holy men in India with the repeated print name of the Hindu god Ram.</p><p>I did not work at the convenience store for long. I left my &quot;Peter&quot; and &quot;Pete&quot; tags behind — but not because I did not like the name change. Rather, I took it in its stride.</p><p>Ever since the 7-Eleven stint, I have continued with my given name, Promod.</p><p>But the memories of gaining my first &quot;Canadian experience&quot; in &quot;friendly Manitoba&quot; are still fresh almost 49 years later — me as Peter or Pete, putting on the omnipresent 7-Eleven logo jacket.</p><hr/><ul>   <li><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/topic/Tag/Your Turn Manitoba"><em><u><strong>Read more opinion pieces published by CBC Manitoba.</strong></u></em><img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a></li>  </ul></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
