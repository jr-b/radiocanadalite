An immunizer at the Steinbach supersite says some days, the negative energy she encounters on the job makes her question whether her efforts are worthwhile.  (CBC)</p></div></div></p><p>A woman who has been working at the Steinbach vaccination supersite since it opened says the typically cheery attitude of most patients earlier has faded recently. It&#x27;s now common for patients to come in grudgingly, and they&#x27;re not subtle about it.</p><p>&quot;It feels just like [a] pressure cooker.… It&#x27;s tense, like you&#x27;re always kind of a little bit leery,&quot; said the woman, who CBC isn&#x27;t naming because she fears she could lose her job.</p><p>&quot;You want to make sure people have a good experience … but people just aren&#x27;t maybe as receptive to hearing what you have to say or having a positive experience, no matter what you do.&quot;</p><h2>Tension takes toll</h2><p>Patients have made offhand comments about how they&#x27;re only getting vaccinated out of fear of losing their jobs, or so they can go visit a loved one in hospital or long-term care facility, she said.</p><p>She&#x27;s heard from co-workers on a couple of occasions recently who were yelled at in the supersite parking lot by someone driving by in a vehicle. </p><p>&quot;The stress is felt by everybody, in every single position,&quot; at the supersite, she said. &quot;That makes you kind of second-guess yourself — like, are you providing the service that&#x27;s really necessary and needed in your community?&quot;</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6170413">Steinbach&#x27;s COVID-19 supersite opening for additional days this month due to &#x27;positive uptake&#x27;</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6054018">Offer &#x27;welcome to the party&#x27; — not blame for being tardy — when vaccine hesitant come around: pastor</a></li></ul></p><p>Asked about the blow to morale described by the Steinbach immunizer and Dunlop, a spokesperson for the province said those attending vaccination sites &quot;are reminded to be respectful of our staff as they are simply doing their jobs to the best of their ability.&quot;</p><p>Staff are trained to deal with clients who may not be comfortable with needles or experience anxiety around being in a public setting, the spokesperson said in a statement.</p><p>During a media briefing on Monday, Dr. Joss Reimer, the medical lead of Manitoba&#x27;s vaccine task force, said she recognizes that immunizing people who are not as eager to get their shot can be difficult work. </p><p>&quot;That work is much more challenging than the initial rollout, where people were genuinely excited to be able to get the vaccine,&quot; she said. </p><p>&quot;None of us like to be in the situation that we are ... but we are in a pandemic and we still are seeing people getting very ill.&quot;</p><p>The Steinbach supersite immunizer agrees staff are doing their best, but thinks what is happening now goes beyond people with anxiety about needles or social settings.</p><p>She feels the tensions she and her co-workers are witnessing likely extend beyond her workplace. Signs of that have already emerged outside of Manitoba.</p><p>A man assaulted a nurse in Sherbrooke, Que., last week because he claimed she didn&#x27;t get his consent before vaccinating his wife, according to local authorities. </p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6185016">Man assaults Sherbrooke nurse after she vaccinated wife without his &#x27;consent,&#x27; police say</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6161817">Reports of assault, verbal abuse as thousands protest vaccine passports outside hospitals across B.C.</a></li></ul></p><p>&quot;I could definitely see how it happened, which is a tragedy,&quot; said the Steinbach immunizer.</p><p>&quot;We&#x27;re not the ones mandating these things, and we&#x27;re there to provide that service to help people. And for that to be how you&#x27;re treated, it is just unconscionable.&quot;</p><h2>Try to shrug off negativity</h2><p>Some days she questions whether she&#x27;ll continue pitching in at the Steinbach supersite. But that internal debate tends to lead her to the same place.</p><p>As long as people continue to come through the doors of the site, grudgingly or not, she intends to stick around.</p><p>The Southern Health region has the lowest COVID-19 vaccination rate among Manitoba&#x27;s five health regions, <a href="https://www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/vaccine/reports.html">at 65.4 per cent as of Friday.<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a> Rates in the Hanover and Steinbach health districts, within the Southern Health region, were 49.9 per cent and 64 per cent, respectively.</p><p>The supersite worker recognizes there are still a lot of needles to get into arms in southeastern Manitoba, which is why she doesn&#x27;t want to quit.</p><p>&quot;We always try and look forward to the light at the end of the tunnel,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;You kind of try and shrug off that negativity and come back and do it again, because you worry — if it wasn&#x27;t for that team that&#x27;s coming in, what position would we all be in?&quot;</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
