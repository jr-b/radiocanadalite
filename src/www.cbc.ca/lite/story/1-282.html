(Submitted by Audrey Moey)</p></div></div></p><p>Last week, John Manconi, the general manager of OC Transpo, told the city&#x27;s transit commission that he planned to &quot;throw everything we&#x27;ve got&quot; at the problem.</p><h2>OC Transpo &#x27;stretched thin&#x27;</h2><p>As part of an <a href="https://www.octranspo.com/en/alerts#alerts-55549">ongoing effort to enhance the R1 service<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a>, OC Transpo announced new measures that included direct trips from downtown to Blair station during the morning and afternoon rush hours, and a Cyrville station bypass for all R1 buses.</p><p>In total, 148 trips over 23 routes have been withdrawn to support the R1 service, but Pat Scrimgeour, OC Transpo&#x27;s director of transit customer systems and planning, said no crucial, first or last trips have been removed.</p><p>&quot;During the period that O-Train Line 1 service is suspended, the R1 replacement bus service is the main spine of the OC Transpo network, and it has the highest priority,&quot; Scrimgeour wrote in an email to CBC.</p><p>High-capacity articulated and double-decker buses have also been reassigned to R1 service to further increase capacity. </p><ul>   <li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6182229">LRT fix could take 3 weeks after latest derailment</a></li>  </ul><p>But Kari Glynes Elliott, a board member with advocacy group Ottawa Transit Riders, worries that despite its best intentions, OC Transpo simply doesn&#x27;t have the capacity to operate the R1 service for an extended period of time.</p><p>&quot;Unless they&#x27;ve suddenly managed to snap their fingers and obtain a whole bunch of new buses and drivers. I think they&#x27;re stretched very thin,&quot; Elliott said.</p><p>&quot;I would say the whole transit system is in decline, and it&#x27;s very, very frustrating. It&#x27;s sort of a spiral of decline where the prices are going up and the service is going down and people are angry and frustrated.&quot;</p><h2>Looking for alternative transportation</h2><p>Tristan Barr is taking matters into his own hands and searching for a private driver to get his 14-year-old son to school and back every day.</p><p>Barr said last week it took his son nearly two and a half hours to get back to his house in Ottawa&#x27;s Westboro neighbourhood from Colonel By Secondary School because of overcrowded buses.</p><p>&quot;I have some pre-existing health conditions that put me at risk for COVID, so we started looking for alternate ways to get them all the way across town,&quot; Barr said.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Tristan Barr and Phoenix Barr"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Tristan Barr and Phoenix Barr</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Tristan Barr and his son Phoenix share a celebratory drink after a big bike ride.
