She noted that in most municipal systems, raw sewage from homes mixes with runoff from rainstorms, leading to backups during big storms, which are happening more often due to climate change.</p><p>&quot;That&#x27;s led to catastrophic flooding and sewage overflows around the country, and not just in the liberal urban hellholes you&#x27;d expect, but also in the red states that God doesn&#x27;t hate,&quot; she deadpanned.</p><p>Meyers devoted his &quot;A Closer Look&quot; feature to the topic, noting that a tornado recently touched down in New Jersey. &quot;You knew it was a New Jersey tornado because it was in a velour track suit shaking down a restaurant for protection money,&quot; he said.</p><p>Meyers also joked that Billy Joel rewrote one of his hits to <em>Actually, We Did Start the Fire</em>, and sang a couple of new verses.</p><p>Many of the shows&#x27; guests were booked specifically to talk about the topic, such as Jane Goodall on <em>The</em> <em>Tonight</em> <em>Show </em>with host Jimmy Fallon and Bill Gates on Corden&#x27;s <em>Late Late Show</em>. Instead of singing, Canadian singer-songwriter Shawn Mendes talked climate change with Colbert.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Embed  | Miscellaneous"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Embed  | Miscellaneous</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY"> </p></div></div></p><p>&quot;Can I say a personal thing?&quot; Corden said to Gates. &quot;Thank you for being the one billionaire who&#x27;s not trying to escape the planet Earth on a spaceship right now.&quot;</p><p>Bravo&#x27;s Andy Cohen was the eighth host to join in the effort.</p><p>But not everyone played along. Greg Gutfeld and his panellists on Fox News Channel mocked the effort and touted the benefits of fossil fuels.</p><p>&quot;Comedy is dead and so is risk in this land of late-night teacher&#x27;s pets,&quot; Gutfeld said. &quot;They went from George Carlin to George Soros.&quot;</p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6180077">More climate pledges needed to avoid &#x27;catastrophic&#x27; path, UN says</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6178697">At 50, Greenpeace is an environmental success story — with a daunting future</a></li></ul></p><p>A half-hour later on CBS, Colbert noted the difficulty in getting many people to focus on the seriousness of the problem.</p><p>&quot;Americans treat climate science like soccer,&quot; he said. &quot;We know it&#x27;s out there and it really matters to the rest of the world, but no one can make us care.&quot;</p></div></div></article><div class="style_relatedLinks__3-Bdr"><h2>More Stories Like This<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h2><p class="style_description__3ldyy">We’re experimenting with a new way of showing related content.
