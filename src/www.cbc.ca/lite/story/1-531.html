Currently, most Apple products use its proprietary <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6186548">Lightning connector</a>, although some iPads and MacBooks use USB-C. </p><p>Android products, produced by Google, use either USB-C ports or its predecessor, the USB Micro-B port.</p><p>&quot;We remain concerned that strict regulation mandating just one type of connector stifles innovation rather than encouraging it, which in turn will harm consumers in Europe and around the world,&quot; said Apple <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58665809">in a statement to the BBC.<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a></p><p>Thun dismissed Apple&#x27;s claim.</p><p>&quot;They have been saying this all the time, that we stop innovation,&quot; she said. &quot;Technology changes, and of course, we should ... but that doesn&#x27;t mean that we must take part in a race in production of electronic waste.&quot;</p><p>The proposal must be debated in European Parliament and by the national governments of member states. If it is passed by member states, manufacturers would have two years to comply. </p><p>&quot;Frankly speaking, I believe that it will be a great success,&quot; Thun said.</p><p>&quot;I hope it will be, so to say, contagious.
