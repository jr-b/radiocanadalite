Post-Brexit immigration rules mean EU citizens can no longer live and work visa-free in Britain, as they could when the U.K. was a member of the bloc.</p><p>Several other countries, including the United States and Germany, are also experiencing a shortage of truck drivers, but the problem has been especially visible in Britain, where it has contributed to empty supermarket shelves and shuttered gas pumps.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Britain Shortages"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Britain Shortages</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: A person fills up their vehicle at a station in south London on Monday.
