Instead a salesperson sold him a Bell Fibe TV package, a landline, a tablet and two-year contracts for high-speed internet and a cell phone.   (Keith Burgess/CBC)</p></div></div></div><div><p>Ross Miller, 85, thought he needed a new TV last October, so he went to The Source — a consumer electronics store owned by Bell Canada. But he got much more than he intended. </p><p>A sales rep signed Miller to two-year contracts for Bell Fibe TV and a new cell phone with data and a warranty plan; sold him a cordless phone, landline and tablet; and signed him to another two-year contract for high-speed home internet. </p><p>Miller, who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, isn&#x27;t clear what happened. He already had a cell phone, which he doesn&#x27;t use, didn&#x27;t know what a tablet was and doesn&#x27;t understand the internet.</p><p>The new products and services &quot;seemed to have been sold to me without my knowledge, I guess,&quot; he told Go Public, shrugging. &quot;That&#x27;s the only explanation I can have. I&#x27;m still not sure how that happened.&quot;</p><p>Miller&#x27;s son has a pretty good idea what happened — he says a sales rep at the store in Toronto&#x27;s Dufferin Mall acted unethically. </p><p>&quot;He went in to get a TV … and came out with everything except a TV,&quot; said James Ogden. &quot;There&#x27;s no justification for what they did, just taking advantage of somebody. It was exploitative.&quot;</p><ul>   <li><strong>Got a story? </strong><a href="http://gopublic@cbc.ca/"><strong>Contact Erica and Go Public team</strong><img src="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/external_link.svg" height="16" width="16" alt="external"/></a></li>  </ul><p>An insider who works at another location of The Source tells Go Public that constant pressure to hit unrealistic sales targets — even when people are staying home because of the pandemic — is forcing employees to make unethical sales.</p><p>He says he and his colleagues are encouraged not to ask too many questions when a customer doesn&#x27;t appear to have good cognitive function. </p><p>&quot;The goal … is to get them pen to paper, signing a contract. So if the person does not have their faculties, then we&#x27;re basically just told to go through the [sales] script,&quot; he said. </p><p>&quot;We are told to just push through.&quot; </p><p>CBC News is not identifying him, because he says he fears he would lose his job.</p><p>He describes intense pressure from his store manager, sharing texts in which they tell the team there are no excuses for not selling and say employees can&#x27;t blame a lack of customers for not making sales.</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Ross Miller TV"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Ross Miller TV</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Miller, 85, isn&#x27;t clear what happened.

(Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press)</p></div></div></p><p>&quot;We do not encourage or support high-pressure sales tactics,&quot; Gibson said. </p><p>The upselling came to light when Ogden visited his dad last November and noticed the Bell Fibe TV receiver — which struck him as odd, because his dad&#x27;s condo fees included Rogers Cable. He soon discovered the other items. </p><p>His dad couldn&#x27;t remember much, so Ogden says he called Bell — over and over. He says the customer service reps simply refused to cancel the TV, internet and cell phone plans, or take back any of the untouched devices.</p><p>Several said his dad was stuck with the cell phone and tablet because he had passed the two-week &quot;buyer&#x27;s remorse&quot; window.</p><p>Out of frustration, Ogden started recording the calls. On one — shared with Go Public — an agent insisted Ogden&#x27;s father was responsible for what happened, despite having Alzheimer&#x27;s, because he signed a contract. </p><p>&quot;Your father was of sound body and mind in order to be able to process and provide the information required to complete the signing of the contract,&quot; said the rep. &quot;End of story.&quot;</p><p><div class="style_embed__3ZlQg" role="figure" aria-label="Image  | Ruodan Shao"><div class="style_embedTextBox__246wi"><p class="style_imageTitle__2Pp22">Image  | Ruodan Shao</p><p class="style_caption__EnXDY">Caption: Ruodan Shao, a business professor and expert in corporate social responsibility, says encouraging ethical conduct pays off for companies in the long run.

So we are encouraged to bundle,&quot; he said. </p><p>Go Public heard from a handful of other current and former employees at The Source, who also say the pressure to meet sales targets is unreasonable.
